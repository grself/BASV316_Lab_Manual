From the start, I wanted students to work with statistics as part of our studies and carry out the types of calculations that are discussed in the text. As I evaluated statistical software I had three criteria: Open Educational Resource (OER). It is important to me that students use software that is available free of charge and is supported by the entire web community. Platform. While most of my students use a Windows-based system, some use Macintosh and it was important to me to use software that is available for all of those platforms. As a bonus, most OER software is also available for the Linux system, though I am not aware of any of my students who are using Linux. Finally, I occasionally have students who are not able to load software on their personal computers (think: Chromebook) so I needed an online capability. Longevity. I wanted a system that could be used in other college classes or in a business setting after graduation. That way, any time a student spends learning the software in my class will be an investment that can yield results for many years. R (just a single letter, R) met those objectives and that is the software I chose to use. This manual started as a series of six lab exercises using R but has grown over the years to the ten topics covered in this edition. Moreover, R is a recognized standard for statistical analysis and could be easily used for even peer-reviewed published papers. It is my hope that students will find the labs instructive and they will then be able to use R for other classes. This lab manual is written with Bookdown tools in RStudio. It is published under a Creative Commons 0 Universal license, essentially “public domain,” (see [Creative Commons License]) with a goal that other instructors can modify and use it to meet their own needs. The source can be found at GITHUB and I always welcome comments. Finally, it was written with base R (R Core Team (2017). R: A language and environment for statistical computing.

["introduction-to-r.html", "Lab 1 Introduction to R 1.1 Types of Data 1.2 The R Command Line 1.3 Data Frames 1.4 Deliverable", " Lab 1 Introduction to R Statistical analysis is the core for nearly all research projects and researchers have a wide variety of statistical tools that they can use, like SPSS and SAS. Unfortunately, these analysis tools are expensive or difficult to master so this lab manual introduces R, a powerful, open source statistical analysis program that is available free of charge. But before diving into a statistics package there is one important background fundamental that must be covered: data. 1.1 Types of Data There are two main types of data and it is important to understand the difference between them since that determines appropriate analytical tests. Continuous data are integer or decimal numbers and are typically used for counts or measures – like a person’s weight, a tree’s height, or a car’s speed. Continuous data are measured with scales that have equal divisions so the difference between any two values can be calculated. Because continuous data include characteristics like means and standard deviations, they are analyzed using parametric tests. Categorical data group observations into a limited number of categories; for example, type of pet (cat, dog, bird, etc.) or place of residence (Arizona, California, etc.). One common type of categorical data is generated with an “agree-disagree” type of scale, like “I enjoy reading: Strongly Agree : Agree : Neutral : Disagree : Strongly Disagree.” Because categorical data do not have characteristics like means or standard deviations, they are analyzed using nonparametric tests. 1.2 The R Command Line All R commands are entered from a “Command Line” environment. Many students find this a bit challenging at first but once they learn some foundational concepts the command line becomes easy and fast to use. This is an explanation for the R script in the box below. 1.2.1 Demonstration: The R Command Line Line 1: This is a comment that is used to record notes in a script. In R, all comments start with a hash-mark (#) and everything after that symbol is ignored. Comments are used frequently in scripts presented in this manual in order to explain what the script is doing. Good programmers comment liberally so team members can easily figure out what they did. Line 2: Calculate the value of 3+5. Line 3: Calculate the value of “5 + 8 * 2”. Lines 6-7: These lines create two variables, MaxScore and MinScore, and then assign values to the variables. You should note two important things about these lines. First, the “assignment” operator is a less than sign followed by a hyphen, making a leftpointing arrow like &lt;-. That tells R to store the number on the right side of the arrow operator into the variable named on the left side of the line. Also, keep in mind that capitalization matters with R. Thus, the variable named MaxScore would be different than a variable named maxscore. These lines only store values in variables and nothing gets printed to the screen. A variable is nothing more than a place in memory to store temporary data. Think of it as a “box” that is used to store something until it is needed later. Line 8: The variable Range is filled with the result of subtracting MaxScore minus MinScore. Line 9: Entering a variable name, like Range, on a line by itself causes the value stored in that variable to be displayed. eyJsYW5ndWFnZSI6InIiLCJzYW1wbGUiOiIjIFNvbWUgYmFzaWMgY2FsY3VsYXRpb25zXG4zICsgNVxuNSArIDggKiAyXG5cbiMgVXNpbmcgdmFyaWFibGVzXG5NYXhTY29yZSA8LSA1N1xuTWluU2NvcmUgPC0gMjJcblJhbmdlIDwtIE1heFNjb3JlIC0gTWluU2NvcmVcblJhbmdlXG5cbiJ9 The DataCamp blocks found throughout this lab manual are designed to “try out” R commands. Click the yellow “Run” button in the lower left corner to execute the entire script and see the results. There are two panels available in the box. Clicking script.R in the top of the box displays the R script and clicking R Console displays the results of executing the script. The commands in the script can be modified and rerun in order to “play around” with R. Also, R commands can be entered directly in the R Console and executed by tapping the ENTER key. 1.2.2 Guided Practice: The R Command Line Now is a time to try some of the command line skills demonstrated above. In the following R codebox, calculate these values. Set the variable M equal to 15 + ( 37 * 2 ) Print the value of M Set the variable N equal to 24 + ( 6 / 2 ) Print the value of N Set the variable P equal to 15 / ( 3 + 2 ) Print the value of P 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 1.2.3 Activity: The R Command Line Calculate the following problems: 5 + 8 * 3 10 * 2/4 5 * 3 + 3 - 20 Include the answers to these three problems in the deliverable document for this lab. eyJsYW5ndWFnZSI6InIiLCJwcmVfZXhlcmNpc2VfY29kZSI6IlxuIyBObyBwcmUtZXhlcmNpc2UgY29kZSBmb3IgdGhpcyBleGVyY2lzZVxuIiwic2FtcGxlIjoiIyBGaW5kIHRoZSB2YWx1ZSBvZiA1ICsgOCAqIDNcblxuIyBGaW5kIHRoZSB2YWx1ZSBvZiAxMCAqIDIvNFxuXG4jIEZpbmQgdGhlIHZhbHVlIG9mIDUgKiAzICsgMyAtIDIwXG5cblxuIn0= 1.3 Data Frames A data frame is a collection of data generated during a research project. An example data frame that is easy to understand would be a spreadsheet that contains the times recorded for a race. R comes configured with a 103 built-in data frames used for training and the R script below is an introduction to one of the data frames used in several of the labs in this manual: stackloss. 1.3.1 Demonstration: Data Frames Line 1: Any line in R that starts with a hash tag is a comment and will be ignored by R. Line 2: Entering the name of the data frame, stackloss, on a line by itself causes R to print the contents of the entire the data frame to the screen. Since stackloss is rather small it is fine to print it to the screen, but some data frames have hundreds of lines and that may cause the screen to “scroll” for some time before the end of the data frame is reached. Line 3: This prints the structure of the stackloss data frame. The result shows that this is a data.frame and has 21 observations (that is how many lines are in the dataset) of 4 variables (things like Air.Flow). Also the structure command displays the type of data that are in the dataset. For example, all 4 variables are of the “number” type. The str function is frequently used to better understand a data frame. The structure for all of the data frames used in this book is contained in the appendix. Line 4: This line puts the maximum Air.Flow value for the stackloss data frame into a variable named MaxAirFlow. Note that the specific vector in the data frame is indicated by both the data frame and vector names separated by a dollar sign, like stackloss$Air.Flow on this line. Line 5: Entering the name of a variable on a line by itself displays the value of that variable so this line displays the maximum value of MaxAirFlow. If some of the lines in the result are too long to fit on one row in the R Console they will wrap around. eyJsYW5ndWFnZSI6InIiLCJzYW1wbGUiOiIjIEV4cGxvcmluZyB0aGUgU3RhY2sgTG9zcyBEYXRhIEZyYW1lXG5zdGFja2xvc3NcbnN0cihzdGFja2xvc3MpXG5NYXhBaXJGbG93IDwtIG1heChzdGFja2xvc3MkQWlyLkZsb3cpXG5NYXhBaXJGbG93XG5cbiJ9 1.3.2 Guided Practice: Data Frames In the following R codebox, explore the airquality data frame.

["central-measures.html", "Lab 2 Central Measures 2.1 Introduction 2.2 N 2.3 Mean 2.4 Trimmed Mean 2.5 Median 2.6 Mode 2.7 Deliverable", " Lab 2 Central Measures 2.1 Introduction It is often desirable to characterize an entire vector of numbers with a single value and the number that is “in the middle” of the vector would seem most logical to use. Students in elementary school are taught how to find the average of a group of numbers and they learn that the average is the best representation for that entire group. In statistics, though, there are several different numbers that are often used to represent an entire vector of numbers and these are collectively known as the Central Measures, or numbers that are the “middle” of the vector. A vector is nothing more than a list of related items. For example, a vector of street names may look like {“elm”, “main”, “first”, “raven”} and a vector of test scores may look like {83, 91, 76, 88}. 2.2 N One of the simplest of measures is nothing more than the number of items in a vector. For example, for the vector 5, 7, 13, 22 the N (number of items) is 4. Technically, N does not identify the middle of a vector but it is an important measure and is included here for completeness. 2.2.1 Demonstration: N To find the number of items in a vector ( N ), use the length procedure as found in the R script below. Line 1: Any line in R that starts with a hash is a comment and is ignored when the script is executed. (Fun fact, the official name for that symbol is “octothorpe”.) Line 2: The length of the eruptions vector in the faithful data frame is printed, which is the same as the number of items in the vector, or N. Notice how a vector is identified using the data frame name then the vector name with a dollar sign operator. eyJsYW5ndWFnZSI6InIiLCJzYW1wbGUiOiIjIEZpbmRpbmcgTlxubGVuZ3RoKGZhaXRoZnVsJGVydXB0aW9ucylcbiJ9 2.2.2 Guided Practice: N Using the attitude data frame, find N for critical. 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 2.2.3 Activity: N Using the cafe data, find the number of items in the age vector and include that number in the deliverable document for this lab. eyJsYW5ndWFnZSI6InIiLCJwcmVfZXhlcmNpc2VfY29kZSI6IlxuY2FmZSA8LSByZWFkLmNzdignaHR0cHM6Ly9sYWJzLmJhc3YzMTYuY29tL2NhZmUuY3N2JylcbiIsInNhbXBsZSI6IiMgRmluZCB0aGUgbnVtYmVyIG9mIGl0ZW1zIGluIHRoZSBhZ2UgdmVjdG9yLlxuXG5cbiJ9 2.3 Mean The mean is calculated by adding all of the data items together and then dividing that sum by the number of items ( N ), which is taught in elementary school as the average. For example, given the vector: 6, 8, 9, the total is 23 and that divided by 3 ( N ) is 7.66; so the mean of 6, 8, 9 is 7.66. 2.3.1 Demonstration: Mean To find the mean of a vector, use the mean procedure as found in the R script below.

As an example, the weight, in grams, of chicks being fed different diets over 21 days ranges from 35 to 373. This is a huge spread with several unusually high weights (some chicks seemed to fare much better on their diets than others). In the end, the mean weight, 121.82g, is not representative of the entire group because those few heavy chicks tended to skew the mean upward. One way to compensate for unusual high, or low, values in a vector is to use a trimmed mean (sometimes called a truncated mean). A trimmed mean is calculated by removing a specific number of values from both the top and bottom of the vector and then finding the mean of the remaining values. In the case of the chick weights, the following table shows the weight mean with various amounts trimmed. Table 2.1: Trimmed Mean Trim Mean 0.00 121.82g 0.05 116.48g 0.10 113.18g 0.15 110.83g The untrimmed mean is 121.82g, but as values are trimmed the unusually high weights are removed. Thus, the trimmed mean better represents the entire group of chick weights. It is not possible, or desirable, to trim a different amount from the top and bottom, a trimmed mean always trims the same amount from both ends of the vector. In actual practice, a trimmed mean is not commonly used since it is difficult to know how much to trim and the resulting mean may be just as skewed as if no values were trimmed; thus, when unusual values are suspected, the best “middle” term to report is the median. 2.4.1 Demonstration: Trimmed Mean The trimmed mean can be easily found in R by adding a “trim” parameter to the mean command, as demonstrated in the following script. Line 1: Any line in R that starts with a hash is a comment and is ignored when the script is executed. Lines 2-4: calculate the trimmed mean by including “trim=…” in the mean function. Line 2 is the mean for the accel vector in the attenu data frame, Line 3 trims 15% from each end of the vector and Line 4 trims 25%. eyJsYW5ndWFnZSI6InIiLCJzYW1wbGUiOiIjIEZpbmQgdHJpbW1lZCBtZWFucyBmb3IgYXR0ZW51XG5tZWFuKGF0dGVudSRhY2NlbClcbm1lYW4oYXR0ZW51JGFjY2VsLCB0cmltPTAuMTUpXG5tZWFuKGF0dGVudSRhY2NlbCwgdHJpbT0wLjI1KVxuIn0= 2.4.2 Guided Practice: Trimmed Mean Using the attitude data frame, find the mean for critical with 15% trimmed. 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 2.4.3 Activity: Trimmed Mean Using the cafe data frame, find the mean for miles with 15% trimmed.

For example, using the vector 6, 8, 9, the middle item (or median) is 8. If the vector has an even number of items, then the median is calculated as the mean between the two middle items. For example, in the vector 6, 8, 9, 13 the median is 8.5, which is the mean of 8 and 9, the two middle terms. The median is very useful in cases where the vector has unusually small or large values. As an example of using a median rather than a mean, consider the vector 5, 6, 7, 8, 30. The mean is (5+6+7+8+30)/5 = 56/5 = 11.2. However, 11.2 is clearly much higher than most of the other numbers in that vector since one unusually high value, 30, is significantly skewing the mean upward. A much better representation of the center of this vector is 7, which is the median. To re-visit the chick weights used above, the median of that vector is 103, which is much more representative of the “middle” weight than using either the mean or the trimmed mean. As another example where the median is the best central measure, suppose a newspaper reporter wanted to find the “average” wage for a group of factory workers. The ten workers in that factory all have an annual salary of $25,000; however, the supervisor has a salary of $125,000. In the newspaper article, the supervisor is quoted as saying that his workers have an average salary of $34,090. That is correct if the mean of all those salaries (including the supervisor’s) is reported, but that number is clearly higher than any sort of reasonable “average” salary for workers in the factory due to the one unusually large salary. In this case, the median of $25,000 would be much more representative of the “average” salary. The median is typically reported for salaries, home values, and other vectors where one or two unusually small or large values typically distort the reported “middle” value. If the vector contains no unusually small or large values, then the mean and median are the same; but if those values exist then these two measures become separated, often by a large amount. Consider the weight vector from the ChickWeight data frame mentioned in the Mean section above. That vector has a mean of 121.82 and a median of 103. This difference, 18.82, is about 15% of the mean and is significant. The size of this difference indicates that there are unusually small or large values in the vector that may be skewing the mean. 2.5.1 Demonstration: Median To find the median of a vector, use the median procedure as found in the R script below. Lines 2-3: Calculate the medians for eruptions and waiting in the faithful data frame. Lines 6-9: Calculate the medians for various vectors in the iris data frame.

For example, if a question asked respondents to select their zip code from a list of five local codes and “12345” was selected more often than any other then that would be the mode for that item. Calculating the mode is no more difficult than counting the number of times the various values are found and choosing the one that is most frequent. As an example, the mtcars data frame lists the following for the number of cylinders in each car: Cylinders N 4 11 6 7 8 14 Since 14 cars have 8 cylinders and that is the most common number of cylinders, that would be the mode for this data item. It does not make much sense to calculate the mean or median for categorical data since those have no numeric value; however, reports frequently list the mean for Likert-style questions (ordered categorical data) by equating each level of response to a number and then calculating the mean of those numbers. For example, imagine that a student housing survey asked respondents to select among “Strongly Disagree, Disagree, Neutral, Agree, Strongly Agree” for a statement like “I like the food in the cafeteria.” That is clearly categorical data and while “Agree” is somehow better than “Disagree” it would be wrong to try to quantify that difference as “two points better.” Sometimes, though, researchers will assign a point value to those responses like “Strongly Disagree” is one point, “Disagree” is two points, and so forth. Then they will calculate the mean for the responses on a survey item and report something like “The question about the food in the cafeteria had a mean of 3.24.” It would be impossible to know how to interpret that sort of number. Are students 0.24 units above “Neutral” on liking the cafeteria food? There is no procedure for finding mode in this tutorial but the tutorial on [Frequency Tables] shows an easy to determine the mode of a variable. In fact, the mtcars$cylinders table above was created with a table command in R and that was used to determine the mode for cylinders. 2.7 Deliverable Complete the activities in this lab and consolidate the responses into a single document.

For example, if a poll of 100 potential Chevrolet customers were asked which model they preferred, it would make a lot of difference to a local automobile seller if the responses were fairly evenly distributed among Impala, Camaro, Traverse, and Corvette compared to results where customers selected 90% Impala with the rest distributed among the others. How tightly survey results are grouped (or scattered) is called “dispersion” and this lab explores data dispersion and the methods used to calculate that value with R. 3.2 Range The maximum and minimum values are those at the extreme ends of a vector and the range is nothing more than the maximum minus the minimum values. For the 2016 version of the Scholastic Aptitude Test (SAT) the maximum score is 1600 and the minimum score is 400, so the range is 1600 - 400, or 1200. Even though the range is sometimes expressed as a single number, as in the case of the SAT scores, researchers normally want to know the actual endpoints rather than just the spread and those endpoints are what R reports for range. 3.2.1 Demonstration: Range To find the range of a vector, use the range function as found in the R script below. Lines 2-4: These display the ranges for three different variables in the trees data frame. Lines 7-8: These lines are very similar to Lines 1-4 but use variables in the rock data frame. This demonstration contains five different examples of finding the range. eyJsYW5ndWFnZSI6InIiLCJzYW1wbGUiOiIjIFJhbmdlIGZvciB0cmVlc1xucmFuZ2UodHJlZXMkR2lydGgpXG5yYW5nZSh0cmVlcyRIZWlnaHQpXG5yYW5nZSh0cmVlcyRWb2x1bWUpXG5cbiMgUmFuZ2UgZm9yIHJvY2suXG5yYW5nZShyb2NrJGFyZWEpXG5yYW5nZShyb2NrJHBlcm0pXG4ifQ== 3.2.2 Guided Practice: Range Using the faithful data frame, find the range for eruptions. 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 3.2.3 Activity: Range Using the cafe data frame, find the range for age.

The first quartile (Q1) is the score that splits the lowest 25% of the values from the rest and the third quartile (Q3) splits the highest 25% of the values from the rest. The second quartile (Q2) is the same as the median and, normally, the term median is used rather than Q2. For example, consider this vector: 5, 7, 10, 13, 17, 19, 23. The median of this vector is 13 because three values are smaller and three are larger. The first quartile is 7, which is the median for the lower half of the values (not including 13, the median of the entire vector); or the score that splits the lowest 25% from the rest of the data. The third quartile is 19, which is the median for the upper half of the scores; or the score that splits the highest 25% from the rest of the data. Occasionally, the word hinges appears in statistical literature. The two hinges for a vector are the medians for the lower half and the upper half of the data, but those halves also include the median for the entire vector. For the simple vector above, the lower hinge is the median of 5, 7, 10, and 13, or 8.5. The upper hinge is the median of 13, 17, 19, and 23, or 18. Quartiles and hinges usually have about the same accuracy but quartiles are more commonly used. 3.3.1 Demonstration: Quartiles R calculates and prints the quartiles, along with several other descriptive measures, using the summary() function. This is a very important function that returns a great deal of useful information and is a staple in a data scientest’s toolbox. To find the quartiles of a vector, use the summary function found in the R script below. Lines 2-4: Display summary information for three different variables in the trees data frame. Lines 7-10: Display summary information for four different variables in the rock data frame. This demonstration contains seven different examples of finding quartiles. eyJsYW5ndWFnZSI6InIiLCJzYW1wbGUiOiIjIFN1bW1hcnkgZm9yIHRyZWVzXG5zdW1tYXJ5KHRyZWVzJEdpcnRoKVxuc3VtbWFyeSh0cmVlcyRIZWlnaHQpXG5zdW1tYXJ5KHRyZWVzJFZvbHVtZSlcblxuIyBTdW1tYXJ5IGZvciByb2NrLlxuc3VtbWFyeShyb2NrJGFyZWEpXG5zdW1tYXJ5KHJvY2skcGVyaSlcbnN1bW1hcnkocm9jayRzaGFwZSlcbnN1bW1hcnkocm9jayRwZXJtKVxuIn0= 3.3.2 Guided Practice: Quartiles Using the USJudgeRatings data frame, find the summary for WRIT. 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 3.3.3 Activity: Quartiles Using the cafe data frame, find the summary for age and record the values for Q1 and Q3 in the deliverable document for this lab. eyJsYW5ndWFnZSI6InIiLCJwcmVfZXhlcmNpc2VfY29kZSI6IlxuY2FmZSA8LSByZWFkLmNzdignaHR0cHM6Ly9sYWJzLmJhc3YzMTYuY29tL2NhZmUuY3N2JylcbiIsInNhbXBsZSI6IiMgVXNpbmcgdGhlIGNhZmUgZGF0YSBmcmFtZSwgZmluZCB0aGUgc3VtbWFyeSBmb3IgYWdlIGFuZCByZWNvcmQgdGhlIHZhbHVlcyBmb3IgUTEgYW5kIFEzLlxuXG4ifQ== 3.4 IQR (Inter-Quartile Range) Another measure of dispersion that is occasionally used is the Inter-Quartile Range (IQR); that is, the difference between Q1 and Q3. To find the IQR for a vector, use the IQR function: IQR. For example, R reports that the difference between Q1 and Q3 for the horsepower vector in the mtcars data frame is 83.5. Since the IQR removes outliers it may sometimes provide a better indication of the data dispersion. 3.4.1 Demonstration: IQR (Inter-Quartile Range) To find the inter-quartile range of a vector, use the IQR function found in the R script below. Note: IQR is one of the few functions in R that uses upper-case letters. Lines 2-4: Display inter-quartile range for three different variables in the trees data frame.

In general, the larger the standard deviation then the more variation there is in the data. A vector with a small standard deviation would create a sharply peaked normal distribution curve while a large standard deviation would create a flatter curve. Once a standard deviation is calculated, then about 68.2% of the samples will lie closer to the mean than that number. To put it another way, one standard deviation explains about 68.2% of the variance from the mean. To show this concept graphically, consider the three following graphs of IQ scores. The mean of an IQ distribution is 100 and one standard deviation is 15. The shaded area under the first curve, in red, includes about 68.2% of all IQ scores. In the same way, two standard deviations from the mean would include about 95.4% of the data points and is illustrated in blue in the second image; and three standard deviations would include more than 99.7% of the data points and is illustrated in green in the third image. As one last example, imagine several classes with a total of 500 students where the professors administered an examination worth 100 points. If the mean score for that examination was 80 and the standard deviation was 5, then the professors would know that the scores were fairly tightly grouped (341 scores of the 500 (68.2%) were between 75-85, within 5 points of the mean), and this would probably be good news. On the other hand, if the mean score was 60 and the standard deviation was 15, then the scores were “all over the place” (more precisely, 341 scores of the 500 were between 45-75), and that may mean that the professors would have to re-think how the lesson was taught or maybe that the examination itself was flawed. It is difficult to categorically state whether a specific standard deviation is good or bad; it is simply a measure of how concentrated the data are around the mean. For something like a manufacturing process where the required tolerance for the parts being produced is tight then the standard deviation for the weights of random samples pulled off of the line must be very small; that is, the parts must be as nearly identical as possible. However, in another context, the standard deviation may be quite large. Imagine measuring the time it takes a group of high school students to run 100 yards. Some would be very fast but others would be much slower and the standard deviation for that data would likely be large. 3.5.1 Demonstration: Standard Deviation To find the standard deviation of a vector, use the sd function as found in the R script below. Lines 2-4: Display standard deviation for three different variables in the trees data frame. Lines 7-10: Display standard deviation for four different variables in the rock data frame.

While that range is fairly large, the standard deviation indicates that the girths of most of the trees were within about 6 inches of each other, so the trees were all about the same size. This is an example of how the standard deviation can provide information to help interpret the range. 3.5.2 Guided Practice: Standard Deviation Using the stackloss data frame, find the standard deviation for Air.Flow. 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 3.5.3 Activity: Standard Deviation Using the cafe data frame, find the standard deviation for age.

Fortunately, R has a great graphic tool for visualizing data descriptives: Boxplot (sometimes called a “Box and Whisker” plot). A Boxplot graphically illustrates Q1, the mean, the median, Q3, outlier boundaries, and outliers (if any are present). 4.2 About Visualizations This site includes several tutorials that are focued on data visualization because it is a critically important tool for analysis. Visualizations are useful in two different phases of the analysis process: exploration and explanation. In the exploration phase, researchers are looking for interesting relationships in the data and those relationships are often difficult to detect in a table full of numbers but a visualization makes them instantly clear. As an example, here are two ways to look at the Volume vector in the trees data frame. #&gt; [1] 10.3 10.3 10.2 16.4 18.8 19.7 15.6 18.2 22.6 19.9 24.2 21.0 21.4 21.3 #&gt; [15] 19.1 22.2 33.8 27.4 25.7 24.9 34.5 31.7 36.3 38.3 42.6 55.4 55.7 58.3 #&gt; [29] 51.5 51.0 77.0 The above table shows the measured volume for 31 Black Cherry Trees. Researchers looking at these numbers would not be able to detect very much. However, a simple box plot reveals a few interesting details, such as the presence of one upper outlier and that the data are positively skewed (the dark “median” line is low in the box). Visualizations like this make it easy to detect a patterns that are not obvious from the data table and researchers commonly use these types of visualizations in the exploratory phase of analysis. In the explanatory phase, where research findings are revealed to the general public, different visualizations that are easier to understand are more appropriate. Researchers must carefully consider the many types of visualizations and which are most useful for exploration or explanation to be certain that the visualizations help rather than hinder understanding. 4.3 Boxplots Following is the summary data for hp from the mtcars data frame along with the boxplot for that same data. #&gt; Min. 1st Qu. Median Mean 3rd Qu. Max. #&gt; 52.0 96.5 123.0 146.7 180.0 335.0 In the boxplot, the median is indicated by a dark line at 123, Q1 is 96.5 (the lower edge of the box) and Q3 is 180 (the upper edge of the box). The following equations show how the “whiskers” are calculated. They indicate the limits for outliers, so any data that lie outside those whiskers are outliers and are indicated by a small circle on the boxplot. \\[ \\begin{aligned} LowerBoundary &amp;= Q1 - (1.5 * IRQ) \\\\ LowerBoundary &amp;= 96.5 - (1.5 * 83.5) \\\\ LowerBoundary &amp;= 96.5 - 125.25 \\\\ LowerBoundary &amp;= 0 \\end{aligned} \\] Since the smallest value in the vector, 52, is larger than the calculated lower boundary, 0, the lower whisker is placed at 52. \\[ \\begin{aligned} UpperBoundary &amp;= Q3 + (1.5 * IRQ) \\\\ UpperBoundary &amp;= 180.0 + (1.5 * 83.5) \\\\ UpperBoundary &amp;= 180.0 + 125.25 \\\\ UpperBoundary &amp;= 305.25 \\end{aligned} \\] Since the calculated upper boundary, 305.25, is smaller than the largest value in the vector, 335.0, the upper whisker is placed at the largest data value that is smaller than or equal to 305.25, or 264 for this data vector. The circle above the boxplot represents an outlier, which is 335 in this vector. If the data are a normal distribution then the whiskers will usually enclose all values in the vector and outliers will be rare. 4.3.1 Demonstration: Boxplots The following script generates four different boxplots for four different vectors in the rock data frame.

For example, imagine a neighborhood where the houses all cost about $150,000. Suppose someone wins a lottery and decides to build a $500,000 house in that same neighborhood. The value of that house would be an outlier in a vector that contains the house values in the neighborhood; that is, it would be outside the “average” house value. Outliers are important when discussing data since they tend to skew certain types of measures. Statistically, outliers are defined as values that lie outside boundaries that are 1.5 times the Inter-Quartile Range (IQR) below the first quartile or above the third quartile. R includes a function that displays the values used to create a boxplot, including outliers, so the values of any outliers can be easily determined. As an example, consider the boxplot for the shape vector in the rock data frame that was created above. 4.4.1 Demonstration: Outliers To determine what values R used to generate a boxplot plot, the command boxplot.stats(rock$shape) is executed and produces this output. eyJsYW5ndWFnZSI6InIiLCJzYW1wbGUiOiIjIFN0YXRzIGZvciBzaGFwZVxuYm94cGxvdC5zdGF0cyhyb2NrJHNoYXBlKVxuIn0= This output has four different lines: $stats These are the locations for the five horizontal lines in the plot, so the lower whisker is at 0.0903 on the y-axis, Q1 (the lower edge of the box) is at 0.1621 on the y-axis, the median (the heavy line in the middle of the box) is at 0.1988 on the y-axis, Q3 (the upper edge of the box) is at 0.2626 on the y-axis, and the upper whisker is at 0.3412 on the y-axis. $n is the number of observations in the vector, or 48 in this case since 48 trees were measured. $conf is the value on the y-axis that would be used to mark a 95% confidence level, but that statistic is not used in this lab. $out These are the values of the outliers and the rock$shape vector has three: 0.438712, 0,464125, and 0.420477. Thus, to find the outliers of a vector all that is needed is to use the fourth output line of the boxplot.stats() function. If there are no outliers then that line reports numeric(0) to indicate that there are zero outliers. 4.4.2 Guided Practice: Outliers Using the iris data frame, use boxplot.stats to see if Sepal.Width has any outliers. 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 4.4.3 Activity: Outliers Using the cafe data frame, find the outliers for miles.

For example, the following boxplots are helpful in determining if there is a difference in automobile weight by the number of cylinders in the engine. By comparing the three boxplots it is easy to see that the more cylinders an engine has then the more the automobile weighs since the plots tend to be “higher” as the number of cylinders increases. Also notice that the plot for 8-cylinder cars does not have an upper whisker since it is exactly the same as Q3 but it does include outliers. It is also interesting to note that the whiskers for the three plots overlap, indicating, for example, that some 4-cylinder cars are heavier than some 6-cylinder cars. Color can be added to a boxplot to make it more pleasing and easier to understand. More information can be found in the About Colors section in the appendix. 4.5.1 Demonstration: Grouped Boxplots With Color Grouped boxplots are easy to create with R and the following script generates three examples. Lines 2-5: This is one long command that is broken over several lines to make it easier to read. Note that R does not require any sort of special “line continuation” character at the end of each line. As long as the parentheses started after the boxplot keyword does not close then R will continue reading that command on the next line. Line 2: Temp ~ Month This tells R to calculate the boxplot for the Temperature variable but group those temperatures by Month. It is important to remember the order for these two variables. First is the continuous data that should be analyzed and second is the grouping variable. Line 3: data = airquality In previous tutorials, the data frame name was prepended to the variable name using the $ operator. However, for simplicity, many R functions are designed to enter only the vector names and then specify the data frame later in the function. In this case, the airquality data frame is identified as the source for the two variables being plotted. Line 4: main = “Temp By Month” This is the main title for the boxplot and is automatically printed in large font abovethe boxplot. R has a number of other formatting options available and several will be covered in later labs. Line 5: col = rainbow(8) This sets the color palette to rainbow and instructs R to use eight colors from that palette. It is often useful to experiment with the number of colors requested from the palette since the colors selected will change depending on the number requested and some combinations may be more useful than others. Lines 7-11: These are similar to Lines 2-5 but use the warpbreaks data frame. Notice that selecting the “heat” color palette is slightly different than the rainbow palette used above. Lines 13-18: These lines are similar to Lines 7-11 but use the chickwts data frame. A new attribute was specified: las = 2. For this boxplot the groups are names of chicken feed rather than numbers or single letters. When those names are printed horizontally they “run into each other” and become unreadable. The las = 2 specification turns those labels 90° so they do not interfere with each other. This demonstration contains three different examples of generating grouped boxplots with color. 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 4.5.2 Guided Practice: Grouped Boxplot With Color Using the morley data frame, generate a grouped boxplot where Speed is grouped by Expt.

The only difference between these two types of tables is in the number of dimensions they display, frequency tables display only a single variable while a crosstab displays two variables. Both of these types of tables are commonly used to display polling data during the run-up to an election and would list things like the number of voters who would support some proposition (frequency table) or that same data broken out by party affiliation, sex, age, or some other category (crosstab). This lab explores both types of table. 5.2 Frequency Table A frequency table is a one-dimensional table that lists a count of the number of times that some categorical data item appears in a vector. As an example, consider the following table which lists the number of cars for each number of cylinders in the mtcars data frame. table(mtcars$cyl) #&gt; #&gt; 4 6 8 #&gt; 11 7 14 This table shows that 11 cars in the data frame had 4 cylinders, 7 had 6 cylinders, and 14 had eight cylinders. Frequency tables are only useful for categorical data-type items. To illustrate why this is true, imagine creating a survey for all of the students at the University of Arizona and including “age” (continuous-type data) as one of the survey questions. Attempting to create a frequency table for the ages of the respondents would have, potentially, more than 65 columns since student ages would range from about 15 to more than 80 and each column would report the number of students for that particular age. While R could create a frequency table that large it would have so many columns that it would be virtually unusable. Normally, if continuous-type data need to be displayed in a table the data are grouped in some way, like ages 15-19, 20-24, etc, so there would be a manageable number of group counts to display. 5.2.1 Demonstration: Frequency Table The following script creates a frequency table.

As an example of a crosstab, consider a table from the mtcars data frame that lists the number of cars by forward gears and the number of cylinders. xtabs(~gear+cyl, data=mtcars) #&gt; cyl #&gt; gear 4 6 8 #&gt; 3 1 2 12 #&gt; 4 8 4 0 #&gt; 5 2 1 2 In this case, one car had a four cylinder engine and three forward gears while 12 cars had eight cylinders and three forward gears. By using a crosstab, a researcher can determine the frequency of some incident (number of cars) by two different criteria (gears and cylinders). Here is a second example from the esoph data frame. xtabs(~agegp+ncases, data=esoph) #&gt; ncases #&gt; agegp 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 8 9 17 #&gt; 25-34 14 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 #&gt; 35-44 10 2 2 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 #&gt; 45-54 3 2 2 2 3 2 2 0 0 0 #&gt; 55-64 0 0 2 4 3 2 2 1 2 0 #&gt; 65-74 1 4 2 2 2 2 1 0 0 1 #&gt; 75+ 1 7 3 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 Notice that there were few cases of esophageal cancer among people under the age of 45 but the number of cases increased between the ages of 45 and 74, with a peak in the 55-64 age group. 5.5.1 Demonstration: Crosstab The following script demonstrates how to create a crosstab. Line 2: The xtabs command (for “Cross Tabs”) creates a crosstab for the variables entered. It is important to notice the tilde character in this function. In many R commands the tilde is used to separate two parts of a formula. The part before the tilde are the data values to be acted upon and the second part are the grouping vectors. In Line 2, there are no data values specified so R will simply count the number of times the various groups show up. The “row” group is listed first and then the “column” group. For example, “gear 3 - cylinder 8” appear 12 times in the data frame. eyJsYW5ndWFnZSI6InIiLCJzYW1wbGUiOiIjIENvdW50IG9mIGdlYXJzIGFuZCBjeWxpbmRlcnNcbnh0YWJzKH5tdGNhcnMkZ2VhcittdGNhcnMkY3lsKVxuIn0= 5.5.2 Guided Practice: Crosstab Using the esoph data frame, create a crosstab for tobgp (tobacco group) and alcgp (alcohol group). 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 5.5.3 Activity: Crosstab Using the cafe data frame, create a crosstab of food and svc.

As an example, consider the mtcars data frame. A researcher wanted to know if there is any relationship between the number of forward gears, the number of cylinders in the engine (that is, the size of the engine), and whether the car had a manual or automatic transmission. Here is the crosstab that was created. xtabs(~cyl+gear+am, data=mtcars) #&gt; , , am = 0 #&gt; #&gt; gear #&gt; cyl 3 4 5 #&gt; 4 1 2 0 #&gt; 6 2 2 0 #&gt; 8 12 0 0 #&gt; #&gt; , , am = 1 #&gt; #&gt; gear #&gt; cyl 3 4 5 #&gt; 4 0 6 2 #&gt; 6 0 2 1 #&gt; 8 0 0 2 When am is 0 (which is the code for an automatic transmission) there were no cars with five forward gears and when am is 1 (manual transmission) there were no cars with three forward gears. 5.6.1 Demonstration: Multi-dimensional Crosstab The following script demonstrates how to create a multi-dimensional crosstab. Line 2: The xtabs command creates a crosstab for the variables entered. In this case, there is nothing on the left side of the tilde so R will return a count of the various categories. Since there are three grouping variables, gear, cyl, and am, R will count instances for all three variables. For example, “gear 4” and “cylinder 4” appear together 2 times when the transmission is 0 and 6 times when the transmission is 1. Note that a data = mtcars parameter is also specified so the $ operator does not need to be used for each variable. This makes the formula easier to read. Line 5: This is another example of multi-dimensional crosstab. This demonstration contains two different examples of generating a multi-dimensional crosstab. eyJsYW5ndWFnZSI6InIiLCJzYW1wbGUiOiIjIENvdW50IG9mIGdlYXJzIGFuZCBjeWxpbmRlcnMgYnkgdHJhbnNtaXNzaW9uXG54dGFicyh+Z2VhcitjeWwrYW0sIGRhdGEgPSBtdGNhcnMpXG5cbiMgQ291bnQgb2YgY2FyYnMgYW5kIGN5bGluZGVycyBieSBlbmdpbmUgdHlwZVxueHRhYnMofmNhcmIrY3lsK3ZzLCBkYXRhID0gbXRjYXJzKVxuIn0= 5.6.2 Guided Practice: Multi-dimensional Crosstab Using the esoph data frame, create a crosstab for tobgp (tobacco group), alcgp (alcohol group), and agegp (age group). 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 5.6.3 Activity: Multi-dimensional Crosstab Using the cafe data frame, create a crosstab of food and svc when grouped by sex.

As another example, the mean horsepower for automobiles can be calculated by the number of forward gears and engine cylinders from the mtcars data frame. aggregate(hp ~ gear + cyl, data = mtcars, FUN = mean) #&gt; gear cyl hp #&gt; 1 3 4 97.0000 #&gt; 2 4 4 76.0000 #&gt; 3 5 4 102.0000 #&gt; 4 3 6 107.5000 #&gt; 5 4 6 116.5000 #&gt; 6 5 6 175.0000 #&gt; 7 3 8 194.1667 #&gt; 8 5 8 299.5000 5.7.1 Demonstration: Calculated Crosstab The following script demonstrates how to create a calculated crosstab. Line 2: This line uses the aggregate command to calculate the mean displacement for each category of cylinders. Notice that this command has a tilde formula where displacement will be aggregated for each category of cylinders. The values to be calculated comes first (displacement) and the grouping variable comes second (cylinder). Next is the name of the dataset used, mtcars. Finally, the statistical function is listed as FUN = mean. Note that the key word FUN is in capital letters. This aggregate function determines that four cylinder cars have a mean displacement of just over 105 cubic inches. Line 5: This line also calculates the mean displacement but groups the result by both number of cylinders and number of forward gears, creating a multi-dimensional calculated crosstab. It calculates that the mean displacement for four cylinder cars with three forward gears is just over 120 cubic inches. This demonstration contains two different examples of generating a calculated crosstab. eyJsYW5ndWFnZSI6InIiLCJzYW1wbGUiOiIjIE1lYW4gb2YgZGlzcGxhY2VtZW50IGJ5IGN5bGluZGVyc1xuYWdncmVnYXRlKGRpc3B+Y3lsLCBkYXRhID0gbXRjYXJzLCBGVU4gPSBtZWFuKVxuXG4jIE1lYW4gb2YgZGlzcGxhY2VtZW50IGJ5IGN5bCBhbmQgZ2VhcnNcbmFnZ3JlZ2F0ZShkaXNwfmN5bCtnZWFyLCBkYXRhID0gbXRjYXJzLCBGVU4gPSBtZWFuKVxuIn0= 5.7.2 Guided Practice: Calculated Crosstab Using the npk data frame, create a calculated crosstab for N (nitrogen), P (phosphate), and K (potassium).

The R command to round a number is round() where the number to be rounded is listed first in the parenthesis and the number of decimal places is listed second. So round(1.3498, 2) would be rounded to 1.35 and round(1.3498, 1) would be rounded to 1.3. The number to be rounded can be a calculated value rather than just a plain number. It is important to note that even if the displayed value is rounded, R still uses the full decimal number for calculations. Also, when rounding a 5, “banker’s” rounding is used, that is, “go to the even digit.” So, 2.5 is rounded to 2.0 but 3.5 is rounded to 4.0. 5.8.1 Demonstrate: Rounding As an example, here is the same aggregate command used in the previous example, but with the results rounded. Notice how the aggregate command is the same, but it is wrapped in a round function to round off the calculations. In the first example the result is rounded to three decimal places and in the second example to two decimal places. This demonstration contains two different examples of rounding. eyJsYW5ndWFnZSI6InIiLCJzYW1wbGUiOiIjIE1lYW4gb2YgZGlzcGxhY2VtZW50IGJ5IGN5bGluZGVyc1xucm91bmQoYWdncmVnYXRlKGRpc3B+Y3lsLCBkYXRhID0gbXRjYXJzLCBGVU4gPSBtZWFuKSwgZGlnaXRzID0gMylcblxuIyBNZWFuIG9mIGRpc3BsYWNlbWVudCBieSBjeWwgYW5kIGdlYXJzXG5yb3VuZChhZ2dyZWdhdGUoZGlzcH5jeWwrZ2VhciwgZGF0YSA9IG10Y2FycywgRlVOID0gbWVhbiksIGRpZ2l0cyA9IDIpXG4ifQ== 5.8.2 Guided Practice: Rounding Using the infert data frame, create a calculated crosstab for case, induced, and spontaneous.

However, there are many ways to visualize frequency data and people using the plots introduced in this tutorial often find it easier to understand the underlying data than with a table. 6.2 Bar Plot A bar plot is used to display the frequency count for categorical data. The following figure is a bar plot showing the number of automobiles with three, four, and five gears according to the mtcars data frame. These types of visuals are more effective than a table full of numbers and they are easy to generate with R. 6.2.1 Demonstration: Bar Plot The following script creates a simple bar plot. Note: this is one long R command that has been broken up over several lines to make it easier to understand. Line 2: This creates a bar plot using the barplot function. The first argument sent to the function is the data source for the heights of each bar in the plot. In this case, R creates a table from the gears variable in mtcars and then uses that table as data input for the plot. All of the other lines in this script embellish the bar plot to make it more usable. Line 3: The “main” attribute sets the main title for the bar plot. In general, for any graphic in R main is used to set the title of the graph. Line 4: This creates the label for the x-axis. Line 5: This creates the label for the y-axis. Line 6: This sets the color palette for the graph. In this case, the rainbow palette is used for the graph. Three colors were requested from that palette but specifying any number larger than three would have worked and created a slightly different palette. Experimentation is needed to find the most suitable palette for any given graph. (Note: More information can be found in the About Colors section in the appendix.) eyJsYW5ndWFnZSI6InIiLCJzYW1wbGUiOiIjIFNpbXBsZSBCYXIgUGxvdFxuYmFycGxvdChoZWlnaHQgPSB0YWJsZShtdGNhcnMkZ2VhciksXG4gIG1haW4gPSBcIk51bWJlciBvZiBDYXJzIEJ5IEdlYXJzXCIsXG4gIHhsYWIgPSBcIkdlYXJzXCIsXG4gIHlsYWIgPSBcIkNvdW50XCIsXG4gIGNvbCA9IGNtLmNvbG9ycygzKVxuKVxuIn0= The DataCamp interface generates graphics in a Plots tab but because of the size of the interface those plots are “squished” and impossible to read.

In general, clustered bar plots are best at showing relationships between variables but not so good for determining the absolute size of each variable. The following plot shows the number of passengers on board the Titanic when it sank. While it is easy to determine that there were a lot more males than females on board, it is not possible to read the exact bar height of, for example, third class males. 6.3.1 Demonstration: Clustered Bar Plot The following script creates a clustered bar plot. Line 3: The first line of the script creates a custom color palette named colpal (for “color palette”), which, contains color codes. In this case, the colorRampPalette function will create the codes for color gradients between blue and white. More information about colors can be found in the About Colors section in the appendix. Line 5: This begins the barplot function. It creates a table that contains the counts for cyl and gear in the mtcars data frame and then uses that table to produce the bar plot. Note the order of the variables in the table command. The grouping variable is listed second. In this example, the cars are grouped by gears and within each group the number of cylinders are displayed. The height of each bar is determined by the count of cars in each group. Lines 6-8: These lines are essentially the same as for a simple bar plot as described above. Line 9: Setting legend to TRUE displays a legend in the corner of the plot. Whenever more than one variable is being plotted it is important to display a legend for the reader. In this case, the legend displays the colors used for the cyl variable. Line 10: A stacked bar is the default type of plot but Line 8 instructs R to create a plot with the variables beside each other. “Stacked” plots are described in the next section of this tutorial. Line 11: This rather odd-looking line adds a title to the legend, otherwise users would be confused about what the various colors used in the plot mean. Line 12: This selects three colors from the colpal variable created in Line 3. eyJsYW5ndWFnZSI6InIiLCJzYW1wbGUiOiJcbiMgQ2x1c3RlcmVkIEJhciBQbG90IFdpdGggR3JhZGllbnQgQ29sb3JzXG5jb2xwYWwgPC0gY29sb3JSYW1wUGFsZXR0ZShjKFwiYmx1ZVwiLCBcIndoaXRlXCIpKVxuXG5iYXJwbG90KGhlaWdodCA9IHRhYmxlKG10Y2FycyRjeWwsIG10Y2FycyRnZWFyKSxcbiAgbWFpbiA9IFwiQ2FycyBieSBHZWFycyBhbmQgQ3lsaW5kZXJzXCIsXG4gIHhsYWIgPSBcIkdlYXJzXCIsXG4gIHlsYWIgPSBcIkNvdW50XCIsXG4gIGxlZ2VuZCA9IFRSVUUsXG4gIGJlc2lkZSA9IFRSVUUsXG4gIGFyZ3MubGVnZW5kID0gbGlzdCh0aXRsZSA9IFwiQ3lsaW5kZXJzXCIpLFxuICBjb2wgPSBjb2xwYWwoMylcbilcbiJ9 6.3.2 Guided Practice: Clustered Bar Plot Using the infert data frame, create a clustered bar plot for spontaneous grouped by education.

In general, these are very difficult to read and should only be used to make broad generalizations. Consider, for example, the following figure. This plot shows admissions for the University of California at Berkeley for six different programs. The top part of each bar (in brown) are the number admitted while the bottom part of each bar (in green) are the number rejected. Look at programs C and D. Were more students accepted in C or in D? Because these two values do not have the same baseline it is impossible to tell for certain which is larger. 6.4.1 Demonstration: Stacked Bar Plot The following script is the same barplot function used in the clustered bar plots above, except beside = TRUE is missing. By default, bar plots are stacked in R so if the “beside” argument is missing (or set to “FALSE”) then the result will be a stacked bar plot. eyJsYW5ndWFnZSI6InIiLCJzYW1wbGUiOiIjIFN0YWNrZWQgQmFyIFBsb3QgV2l0aCBHcmFkaWVudCBDb2xvcnNcbmNvbHBhbCA8LSBjb2xvclJhbXBQYWxldHRlKGMoXCJCcm93blwiLCBcIndoaXRlXCIpKVxuXG5iYXJwbG90KGhlaWdodCA9IHRhYmxlKG10Y2FycyRjeWwsIG10Y2FycyRnZWFyKSxcbiAgbWFpbiA9IFwiTnVtYmVyIG9mIENhcnMgYnkgR2VhcnMgYW5kIEN5bGluZGVyc1wiLFxuICB4bGFiID0gXCJHZWFyc1wiLFxuICB5bGFiID0gXCJDb3VudFwiLFxuICBjb2wgPSBjb2xwYWwoMyksXG4gIGxlZ2VuZCA9IFRSVUUsXG4gIGFyZ3MubGVnZW5kID0gbGlzdCh0aXRsZSA9IFwiQ3lsaW5kZXJzXCIpXG4pXG4ifQ== It should be evident that the bar plot created in the above script is not very useful. While it is fairly easy to see that the number of 8-cylinder cars with three gears is much larger than the other categories, it is difficult to determine, for example, how many cars have five gears and eight cylinders. This difficulty is even worse when there are more than three levels for either of the two variables being plotted. 6.4.2 Guided Practice: Stacked Bar Plot Using the infert data frame, create a stacked bar plot for induced grouped by education.

The human brain seems able to easily compare the heights of two or more bars, as in bar plots, but the areas of two or more slices of a pie chart are difficult to compare. For this reason, pie charts should be avoided in research reports. If they are used at all, they should only illustrate one slice’s relationship to the whole, not comparing one slice to another; and no more than four or five slices should ever be presented on one chart. The following figure shows the results of an experiment reported in the chickwts data frame to compare the effectiveness of various feed supplements on the growth rate of chickens. This figure illustrates the problem with pie charts. Notice that “casein” seems to promote growth better than “horsebean,” but it is impossible to determine if “casein” is better than “sunflower” from this chart. 6.5.1 Demonstration: Pie Chart The following script creates a pie chart. Line 2: This starts a pie chart function. The “x” parameter is the data that needs to be charted. In this line, the feed variable in the chickwts data frame is extracted to a table since the pie chart function expects input in the form of a table. Lines 3-4: These lines define the main title and colors used for the pie chart. These parameters are the same as was seen in other graphs in this lab. Line 5: This tells R to use the labels used in the feed variable as the labels on the pie chart. eyJsYW5ndWFnZSI6InIiLCJzYW1wbGUiOiIjIENvdW50IG9mIENoaWNrcyBieSBGZWVkXG5waWUoeCA9IHRhYmxlKGNoaWNrd3RzJGZlZWQpLFxuICBtYWluID0gXCJDb3VudCBvZiBDaGlja3MgYnkgRmVlZFwiLFxuICBjb2wgPSByYWluYm93KDYpLFxuICBsYWJlbHMgPSBjKGxldmVscyhjaGlja3d0cyRmZWVkKSlcbiAgKVxuIn0= Note: The pie chart shows the number of chicks that were given a particular type of feed.

They are also routinely used on weather maps to depict areas with the greatest probability for rain or snow. While heat maps can be displayed in a geographical format where, for example, the various states are shaded to represent some factor, they are also commonly seen as a grid. The following figure shows a heat map was taken from the swiss data frame and shows various socioeconomic indicators by province in Switzerland from 1888. In a heat map produced by R, lighter colors represent larger numbers. Thus, the province with the highest fertility rate is Franches-Mnt since it has the lightest color and the province with the least agriculture is Courtelary since it has the darkest color for those variables. Interpreting the heat map can be a challenge for the researcher. In some cases a light color would be positive and in others negative. For example, the highest education level would be in Neuveville (positive) but the highest infant mortality would be in Porrentruy (negative). Also, the colors are often very similar and difficult to distinguish. For example, for examination, Cossonay has a numeric value of 22 while Aigle has 21. These two colors are slightly different but it would be difficult to detect that from the image. Often, the best that can be done with a heat map is identifying broad generalizations. 6.6.1 Demonstration: Heat Map The following script creates a heat map for Party Size by Meal in the cafe data frame. Line 4: This line creates a contingency table from columns 8 and 4 of the cafe data frame and store that table in a variable named htbl. Those two columns contain the data requested for this heatmap, column 8 is the party size and column 4 is the meal. Line 5: R can store data in several different formats and many, like vector and data frame, are used by other labs in this manual. Heat maps require data to be in a matrix format and this line converts the htbl contingency table into a matrix named hmap. Line 6: This is the start of the heat map function. This line instructs R to create a heat map from the hmap matrix created in Line 5. Line 7: The main title of the heatmap is Cafe Ptysize by Meal. Line 8: The x-axis is labeled Meal. Line 9: The y-axis is labeled Ptysize. Line 10: This suppresses the row dendogram that is used to order the rows. The best way to see what this line does is to comment it out and re-run the script. Line 11: This suppresses the column dendogram. Line 12: Sets the heat map to scale the columns. In this way, the color for each column cell is calculated such that the entire column’s mean is zero and the standard deviation is one. The other option is to scale “row” and researchers would want to try both to see which provides a better heat map. Line 13: This sets the right and bottom margins. The values were found by simple trial-and-error to produce the most legible heat map. eyJsYW5ndWFnZSI6InIiLCJwcmVfZXhlcmNpc2VfY29kZSI6IlxuY2FmZSA8LSByZWFkLmNzdignaHR0cHM6Ly9sYWJzLmJhc3YzMTYuY29tL2NhZmUuY3N2JylcbiIsInNhbXBsZSI6IlxuIyBDYWZlIFBhcnR5IFNpemUgYnkgTWVhbFxuaHRibCA8LSB0YWJsZShjYWZlWyxjKDgsNCldKVxuaG1hcCA8LSBhcy5tYXRyaXgoaHRibClcbmhlYXRtYXAoaG1hcCxcbiAgbWFpbiA9IFwiQ2FmZSBQdHlzaXplIGJ5IE1lYWxcIixcbiAgeGxhYiA9IFwiTWVhbFwiLFxuICB5bGFiID0gXCJQdHlzaXplXCIsXG4gIFJvd3Y9TkEsXG4gIENvbHY9TkEsXG4gIHNjYWxlPVwiY29sdW1uXCIsXG4gIG1hcmdpbnM9Yyg4LDMpXG4pXG4ifQ== The following script creates a heat map for the [USJudgeRating] data frame. Line 1: R can store data in several different formats and many, like vector and data frame, are used by other tutorials in this series. Heat maps require data to be in a matrix format and this line converts the first 20 lines, out of 43, in the data frame into a matrix named hmap. Notice how the first twenty lines in that data frame are specified, using [20:1,] which also reverses their order so they are alphabetized. Finally, x is the name of the parameter in the as.matrix function that receives the input data. Line 2: This is the start of the heat map function. This line instructs R to create a heat map from the hmap matrix. R designates the input variable for heatmap to be x. Line 3: The main title of the heatmap is US Judge Ratings. Line 4: The x-axis is labeled Characteristic. Line 5: This suppresses the row dendogram that is used to order the rows. The best way to see what this line does is to comment it out and re-run the script. Line 6: This suppresses the column “dendogram.” Line 7: Sets the heat map to scale the rows. In this way, the color for each row cell is calculated such that the entire row’s mean is zero and the standard deviation is one. The other option is to scale “column” and researchers would want to try both to see which provides a better heat map. Line 8: This sets the right and bottom margins. The values were found by simple trial-and-error to produce the most legible heat map. Note that colors were not specified for this heat map. While a special color palette could be used, the default colors used by R work well. eyJsYW5ndWFnZSI6InIiLCJzYW1wbGUiOiJobWFwIDwtIGFzLm1hdHJpeCh4ID0gVVNKdWRnZVJhdGluZ3NbMjA6MSxdKVxuaGVhdG1hcCh4ID0gaG1hcCxcbiAgbWFpbiA9IFwiVVMgSnVkZ2UgUmF0aW5nc1wiLFxuICB4bGFiID0gXCJDaGFyYWN0ZXJpc3RpY1wiLFxuICBSb3d2PU5BLFxuICBDb2x2PU5BLFxuICBzY2FsZT1cInJvd1wiLFxuICBtYXJnaW5zPWMoOCwzKVxuKVxuIn0= 6.6.2 Guided Practice: Heat Map Create a heat map for the attitude data frame.

The following figure is a mosiac plot that indicates the relationship between the number of gears and cylinders in several cars in the mtcars data frame. Notice that 8-cylinder cars overwhelmingly have three gears while 4-cylinder cars tend to have four gears. This plot gives a quick visual representation of the relationships between categorical variables, just as a pie chart shows the relationship between continuous variables. A mosiac plot would suffer the same weaknesses as a pie chart and are, generally, rather difficult to interpret. 6.7.1 Demonstration: Mosaic Plot The following script creates a mosiac plot. Line 2: A mosiac plot requires the input to be in table format so this line creates a table from the gear and cyl variables in the mtcars data frame.

For example, imagine a project involving corn production where researchers applied a treatment to 50 acres of corn but not to another 50 acres in a nearby field. At the end of the growing season they found that the untreated field yielded 150 bushels per acre while the treated field yielded 170 bushels per acre. This would indicate a correlation, or relationship, between the treatment applied and the crop yield. Regression analysis is a statistical method that uses correlation to find trends in data. With regression analysis, it is possible to predict the unknown value of the dependent variable based on a known value of the independent variable. For example, if a researcher recorded the 100 real estate sales in a small town along with the age of the houses being sold then it would be possible to use regression analysis to predict the selling price for a house when given its age. This lab explores both correlation and regression. 7.1.1 Causation From the outset of this lab, it is important to remember that correlation does not equal causation. If two factors are correlated, even if that correlation is quite high, it does not follow that one is causing the other. As an example, if a research project found that students who spend more hours studying tend to get higher grades this would be an interesting correlation. However, that research, by itself, could not prove that longer studying hours causes higher grades. There would be other intervening factors that are not accounted for in this simple correlation (like the type of final examination used). As an egregious example of this point, consider that the mean age in the United States is rising (that is, people are living longer; thus, there are more elderly people) and that the crime of human trafficking is increasing. While these two facts may be correlated, it would not follow that old people are responsible for human trafficking! Instead, there are numerous social forces in play that are not accounted for in this simple correlation. It is important to keep in mind that correlation does not equal causation. 7.1.2 Definition A correlation is a number between -1.0 and +1.0, where 0.0 means there is no correlation between the two variables and either +1.0 or -1.0 means there is a perfect correlation. A positive correlation means that as one variable increases the other also increases. For example, as people age they tend to weigh more so a positive correlation would be expected between age and weight. A negative correlation, on the other hand, means that as one variable increases the other decreases. For example, as people age they tend to run slower so a negative correlation would be expected between age and running speed. Here are the verbal definitions that are commonly accepted for a correlation’s value. Table 7.1: Correlation Descriptions Correlation Description +.70 or higher Very strong positive +.40 to +.69 Strong positive +.30 to +.39 Moderate positive +.20 to +.29 Weak positive +.19 to -.19 No or negligible -.20 to -.29 Weak negative -.30 to -.39 Moderate negative -.40 to -.69 Strong negative -.70 or less Very strong negative 7.2 Pearson’s r Pearson’s Product-Moment Correlation Coefficient (normally called Pearson’s r) is a measure of the strength of the relationship between two variables having continuous data that are normally distributed (they have bell-shaped curves). (Note: The Introduction to R tutorial contains information about various data types. The following examples of correlation using Pearson’s r are from the mtcars dataset. Table 7.2: Correlations of Continuous Data Variables Correlation Description disp-mpg -0.8476 Very Strong Negative wt-mpg -0.8677 Very Strong Negative wt-qsec -0.1747 No Correlation disp-qsec -0.4337 Strong Negative drat-qsec +0.0912 No Correlation 7.2.1 Demonstration: Pearson’s r The following script demonstrates how to calculate Pearson’s r. Line 2: This is the start of the cor.test function, which calculates the correlation between two variables. That function requires the x-axis variable be listed first then the y-axis variable. Line 3: This is a continuation of the cor.test function call and specifies the method to be Pearson’s r. Since Pearson’s r is the default method for the cor.test function this line did not need to be included but it is used in this example since the specification will be important in later examples in this lab. eyJsYW5ndWFnZSI6InIiLCJzYW1wbGUiOiJcbiMgUGVhcnNvbidzIHJcbmNvci50ZXN0KGFpcnF1YWxpdHkkV2luZCwgYWlycXVhbGl0eSRPem9uZSxcbiAgbWV0aG9kID0gXCJwZWFyc29uXCIpXG4ifQ== The cor.test function returns a lot of information that will be important in later tutorials; however, here is an explanation for the result of this function. Pearson’s product-moment correlation: This is the title of the function being executed. data: …: This lists the two variables being correlated. t=…: This line is the result of the calculation. The “t” score is used to calculate the p-value at the end of the line. The “df” are the “degrees of freedom” and is a measure of how many different levels the variables can take. The “p-value” is the probability value and, normally, a p-value less than 0.05 is considered significant. (Significance and p-value are discussed later in this tutorial.) alternative…: The alternative hypothesis being tested. The default is that the correlation is not equal to zero and this line simply states the alternative hypothesis so the researcher can compare that hypothesis with the correlation and p-value to see if the null hypothesis can be rejected. (“Hypothesis” is discussed in the Parametric Hypothesis Testing tutorial.) 95 percent…: This shows the 95% confidence level for the true correlation. In this case, the true correlation should be between -0.706 and -0.471. sample estimates: This begins the “estimates” section of the report. cor: This verifies that the test executed was Pearson’s r (Spearman’s will report rho and Kendall’s will report tau). -0.6015465: This is the calculated correlation between the two variables. 7.2.2 Guided Practice: Pearson’s r Using the CO2 data frame, calculate Pearson’s r for the variables conc and uptake. 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 7.2.3 Activity: Pearson’s r Using the cafe data frame, determine the correlation between the length of the meal and the bill to see if longer meals tend to cost more.

Other than the process used, the concept is exactly the same as for Pearson’s r and the result is a correlation between -1.0 and +1.0 where the strength and direction of the correlation is determined by its value. Spearman’s rho is used when at least one variable is ordered data and typically involves larger data samples while Kendall’s tau can be used for any type of categorical data but is more accurate for smaller data samples. (Note: “ordered data” have categories that imply some sort of order but the difference between the categories cannot be calculated. As an example, if some people strongly agree with a statement and others strongly disagree there is an obvious difference in those opinions but it would be impossible to arithmetically calculate that difference.) For example, imagine a research project that is attempting to determine movie preference by a person’s age. The researcher could ask a large group of people to indicate their age and how well they liked certain types of movies by giving each a “star” rating. Clearly, types that are rated five-star are somehow better than those rated four-star, but it is not possible to quantify that difference in any sort of meaningful way. Spearman’s rho would be used to calculate a correlation between age and movie rating. If that correlation came out to -0.632 (this is a made-up number) for “horror” movies then the researcher could conclude that there is a negative relationship between age and preference for horror movies. That is, as people age they tend to not prefer horror movies. On the other hand, imagine that a dataset included information about the age of people who purchased various makes of automobiles. If the “makes” are selected from a list (Ford, Chevrolet, Honda, etc.) then the data are categorical but no order is implied (that is, “Ford” is neither better or worse than “Chevrolet”) so Kendall’s tau would be used to calculate the correlation between the customers’ preference for the make of an automobile and their ages. Perhaps the correlation would come out to +0.534 (this is a made-up number). This would indicate that there was a strong positive correlation between these two variables; that is, people tend to prefer a specific make based upon their age; or, to put it another way, as people age their preference for automobile make changes in a predictable way. The following examples are from the mtcars dataset and since they all involve ordered data Spearman’s rho was used to calculate the correlations. Table 7.3: Correlations of Categorical Data Variables Correlation Description cyl—gear -0.5643 Strong Negative gear—am +0.8077 Very Strong Positive cyl—carb +0.5801 Strong Positive carb—gear +0.1149 No Correlation vs—carb -0.6337 Strong Negative 7.3.1 Demonstration: Spearman’s rho The following script demonstrates using cor.test to calculate correlations from the esoph data frame using Spearman’s rho. The process for this calculation is the same as for Pearson’s r except the method specified is “spearman”. There is one other difference between this script and the first. Notice on line 2 that esoph$agegp is inside an as.numeric function. Since agegp uses text like “25-34” instead of a number this converts that to a number for Spearman’s rho. (Note: This script will generate a warnings about p-values but that can be safely ignored for this tutorial.) eyJsYW5ndWFnZSI6InIiLCJzYW1wbGUiOiJcbiMgU3BlYXJtYW4ncyByaG9cbmNvci50ZXN0KGFzLm51bWVyaWMoZXNvcGgkYWdlZ3ApLCBlc29waCRuY2FzZXMsXG4gIG1ldGhvZCA9IFwic3BlYXJtYW5cIilcbiJ9 The interpretation of the results of Spearman’s rho is similar to that for Pearson’s r and will not be further explained here. 7.3.2 Guided Practice: Spearman’s rho Using the CO2 data frame, calculate Spearmans’s rho for the variables Plant (which is ordered) and uptake. 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 7.3.3 Activity: Spearman’s rho Using the cafe data frame, determine the correlation between age and service (svc) to see if there is a relationship between a customer’s age and their rating for the service.

Here is a quick chart to help. Table 7.4: Correlation by Data Type Correlation Data Pearson’s r both data items being correlated are continuous. Spearman’s rho at least one variable is ordered and the sample size is large. Kendall’s tau at least one variable is categorical (but not necessarily ordered) and the sample size is small. Imagine a survey where college students were asked to check a box for their class (freshman-sophomore-etc.) and enter their age in years. Spearman’s rho would be used to correlate these two data items since the class is ordered (“senior” comes after “junior”) and age is continuous. 7.5 Significance Most people use the word significant to mean important but researchers and statisticians have a much different meaning for the word significant and it is vital to keep that difference in mind. In statistics and research, significance means that the experimental results were such that they would not likely have been produced by mere chance. For example, if a coin is flipped 100 times, heads should come up 50 times. Of course, by pure chance, it would be possible for heads to come up 55 or even 60 times. However, if heads came up 100 times, researchers would suspect that something unusual was happening (and they would be right!). To a researcher, the central question of significance is “How many times can heads come up and still be considered just pure chance?” In general, researchers use one of three significance levels: 1%, 5%, or 10%. A researcher conducting The Great Coin-Tossing Experiment may start by simply stating “This result will be significant at the 5% level.” That would mean that if the coin were tossed 100 times, then anything between 47.5-52.5 (a 5% spread) “heads” tosses would be considered merely chance. However, 47 or 53 “heads” would be outside that 5% spread and would be significant. It must seem somewhat subjective for a researcher to simply select the desired significance level, but an overwhelming number researchers in business and the social and behavioral sciences (like education, sociology, and psychology) tend to choose a significance level of 5%. There is no real reason for choosing a 5% level other than it is just the way things have traditionally been done for many years. Therefore, if a researcher selected something other than 5%, peer researchers would want some explanation concerning the “weird” significance level. The calculated significance is typically reported as a p-value (for “probability value”). The following table contains the correlation and p-value for several pairs of variables from the mtcars data frame. Table 7.5: P-Values for Selected Correlations Variables Correlation Pvalue wt—qsec -0.1747 0.3389 am—hp -0.2432 0.1798 hp—drat -0.4488 0.009989 cyl—vs -0.8108 1.843 x 10-08 wt—disp +0.8880 1.222 x 10-11 If a 5% significance level were specified for this data then any p-value smaller than 0.05 is considered significant; that is, the observed relationship is not likely due to chance. Given that, there is no significance in the correlation between wt—qsec and between am—hp since the p-values for those correlations are greater than 0.05. However, the correlations between the other variables are significant since the p-values for those are smaller than 0.05. 7.5.1 Demonstration: Significance One of the statistics calculated by cor.test is the p-value, so that test can be used to find significance along with a correlation. The following script demonstrates using cor.test to find the significance in the correlation between Wind and Temp in the airquality data frame. eyJsYW5ndWFnZSI6InIiLCJzYW1wbGUiOiJcbiMgU2lnbmlmaWNhbmNlXG5jb3IudGVzdChhaXJxdWFsaXR5JFdpbmQsIGFpcnF1YWxpdHkkVGVtcCxcbiAgbWV0aG9kID0gXCJwZWFyc29uXCIpXG4ifQ== At the end of line two of the results (not counting the title line), the p-value is reported at 2.642e-09, which is how R reports 2.642 × 10-09, and that is far smaller than 0.05. This correlation, then, would be considered statistically significant. 7.5.2 Guided Practice: Significance Using the CO2 data frame, calculate the p-value for the correlation between conc and uptake.

Moreover, if the data points in the scatter plot are all close to the regression line, then it indicates a strong correlation. As an example, in the mtcars dataset the calculated Pearson’s r for Quarter-mile Time and Horsepower is -0.708. These two variables have a strong negative correlation and are plotted below. While regression analysis can have many uses, one of the simplest and most common is to make y-axis predictions for new x-axis values. Using r’s linear model function (lm), the line drawn in the above figure was determined to have a slope of -0.01846 and a y-intercept of 20.55635. Using this information and the slope intercept equation, \\(y = mx + b\\), the quarter-mile time (y-axis) for a new horsepower (x-axis) can be predicted. For example, the following predicts the quarter-mile time for a horsepower of 200. \\[ \\begin{aligned} y &amp;= mx + b \\\\ y &amp;= (-0.01846 * 200) + 20.55635 \\\\ y &amp;= -3.692 + 20.55635 \\\\ y &amp;= 16.86435 \\end{aligned} \\] In the equation, m is the slope of the regression line and b is the y-intercept. By plugging in the new value for x, a simple calculation will determine the predicted value for y, which is 16.86 (rounded). Regression analysis becomes less certain if the supplied x value is at the edge or outside the main body of the scatter plot. For example, using the above figure, it is mathematically possible to predict the quarter-mile time (y-axis) for a horsepower of 50. \\[ \\begin{aligned} y &amp;= mx + b \\\\ y &amp;= (-0.01846 * 50) + 20.55635 \\\\ y &amp;= -0.923 + 20.55635 \\\\ y &amp;= 19.63 \\end{aligned} \\] However, since the selected x value is at the very edge of the main body of the scatter plot then the calculated y value is suspect and should not be reported. 7.6.1 Demonstration: Prediction by Regression The following r script uses the lm function to find the values of \\(m\\) and \\(b\\) for a correlation between two variables. Then, it calculates a predicted value for y when given an x value. Line 3: The slope-intercept equation is noted in a comment on line 3. Line 5: This line executes the lm function to generate a “linear model” (the line of best fit) for horsepower (x-axis) and quarter-mile time (y-axis) in the mtcars data frame. The result of this function is stored in a variable named lmod. It is important to ensure that the variables are entered in the correct order or the linear model will be backwards. The dependent variable (the y-axis) is listed first and then the independent variable (the x-axis). Thus, it is expected that the quarter-mile time is dependent on the horsepower of the car, not the other way around. Lines 6-7: Each of these lines store one number in a variable for use in Line 13. There is an odd format used to extract each of these numbers. lmod contains a lot of information, including dozens of numbers, and Line 6 (the slope) accesses the coef section of lmod and extracts just the slope and then stores it in a variable named b. Line 7 accesses the coef section of lmod and extracts just the intercept and stores it in a variable named m. Line 10: The new value of horsepower is stored in a variable named x. In this case, the quarter-mile time for a car with 250 horsepower is being predicted Line 13: This is the slope-intercept equation written in R format and it is executed with the variables stored in Lines 6, 7, and 10. eyJsYW5ndWFnZSI6InIiLCJzYW1wbGUiOiIjIERlbW9uc3RyYXRpb246IFByZWRpY3Rpb24gYnkgUmVncmVzc2lvblxuXG4jIFNsb3BlLWludGVyY2VwdCBlcXVhdGlvbjogeSA9IG14ICsgYlxuIyBGaXJzdCwgZGV0ZXJtaW5lIG0gYW5kIGJcbmxtb2QgPC0gbG0obXRjYXJzJHFzZWMgfiBtdGNhcnMkaHApXG5iIDwtIGNvZWYobG1vZClbWzFdXSAjIHNsb3BlXG5tIDwtIGNvZWYobG1vZClbWzJdXSAjIGludGVyY2VwdFxuXG4jIE5vdywgc3BlY2lmeSB0aGUgdmFsdWUgb2YgeFxueCA8LSAyNTAuMFxuXG4jIENhbGN1bGF0ZSB0aGUgcHJlZGljdGVkIHkgdmFsdWVcbihtICogeCkgKyBiXG4ifQ== 7.6.2 Guided Practice: Prediction by Regression Using the airquality data frame, predict the Wind (y-axis) when the Temp (x-axis) is 80 degrees. 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 7.6.3 Activity: Prediction by Regression Using the cafe data frame, predict the tip from a customer who is 48 years old.

Visualizations can make subtle relationships evident, and those relationships could be missed by just looking at a data table. Earlier tutorials described visualization techniques for descriptive and frequency data and this tutorial applies the same consideration to quantitative data. 8.2 Histogram A histogram is a graph that shows the disribution of data that are continuous in nature, for example, age or height. A histogram resembles a bar chart but there is an important difference: a histogram is used for continuous data while a bar chart is used for categorical data. To emphasize that difference, histograms are normally drawn with no space between the bars (the data are continuous along the entire x-axis) while bar charts are normally drawn with a small space between bars (the data are categorical along the x-axis). As an example of a histogram, the next figure shows the New York city high temperature from May to September 1973 from the airquality data frame. Notice that there is not a separate bar for each temperature; rather, R has clustered five temperatures into a single bar. Thus, there is a bar that combines the temperatures 70-74 and not separate bars for each of those temperatures. This histogram helps researchers determine if temperature is normally distributed, that is, does it display a typical “bell” curve. It should be fairly obvious from this graph that there are more temperatures around the 80° level than at either extreme so this histogram does indicate that the data are normally distributed. As another example, the following figure shows a histogram for the body temperature of a beaver recorded every 10 minutes over the course of several hours, as found in the [beaver1] data frame. This histogram shows normally-distributed data though there is an outlier at a temperature of 37.6°. Histograms can also indicate data that are skewed and this would be important to researchers during a project’s exploratory phase. Consider, for example, the following figure which is the shape of petroleum rock samples in the rock data frame. While this histogram still indicates a normal distribution with levels falling off from a peak, there is a longer “tail” to the right so the data have a positive skew. Finally, consider the histogram in the following figure, which is taken from the peri vector in the rock data frame. This shows a bi-modal distribution where there are two clear peaks in the data. It is critical for researchers to know that the data are bi-modal before they begin analyzing it since having two modes can cause certain statistical tests to fail. 8.2.1 Demonstration: Histogram The following script creates an example histogram. Line 2: This is the beginning of the histogram function (it ends on Line 8). For this histogram the Speed variable from the morley data frame is specified as the data source for the histogram. Lines 3-5: This creates the main title of the histogram along with the labels for the x-axis and y-axis. Line 6: To create a histogram, R analyzes the values contained in a variable and creates “bins” for those values. That means that many of the continuous values will be grouped into a single bin for analysis. The “breaks” parameter tells R how many breaks to allow in the variable. In this case, eight breaks are specified, which would create nine bins. R will analyze the data and use the “breaks” parameter as a “suggestion” and will only use that number of breaks if it makes sense for the data being graphed. Often, changing the number of breaks by just one or two will not change the histogram produced so researchers should play around with the “breaks” number to get the best possible representation of the data. Line 7: This specifies that 10 colors will be used from the “cm.color” palette to shade the various bars in the histogram. Researchers need to experiment a bit with the color palette and number of colors to get the best result; however, “cm.color” along with the number of bars in the histogram seems to work well for this histogram. (Note: More information about color can be found in the About Colors section in the appendix.) eyJsYW5ndWFnZSI6InIiLCJzYW1wbGUiOiIjIEhpc3RvZ3JhbVxuaGlzdChtb3JsZXkkU3BlZWQsXG4gIG1haW4gPSBcIk1vcmxleSdzIEV4cGVyaW1lbnRcIixcbiAgeGxhYiA9IFwiU3BlZWRcIixcbiAgeWxhYiA9IFwiRnJlcXVlbmN5XCIsXG4gIGJyZWFrcyA9IDgsXG4gIGNvbCA9IGNtLmNvbG9ycygxMClcbilcbiJ9 The DataCamp interface generates graphics in a Plots tab but because of the size of the interface those plots are “squished” and impossible to read.

Here is the same NY City temperature data from an earlier histogram but drawn as a density plot. Given the previous plot it is natural to wonder, “What is density?” This is a calculated value such that the total area under the curve is assumed to be one and then each point along the x-axis is calculated to contribute the correct proportional amount to that total density. For many purposes it is adequate to just consider a density plot to be a smoothed histogram. As just one other example, following is a density plot of the bi-modal histogram presented earlier. The density plot makes the bi-modal nature of the data very evident. 8.3.1 Demonstration: Density Plot The following script creates a density plot for the Rape vector in the USArrests data frame.

These types of graphs are especially useful with what is called “time series” data; that is, data that are gathered over a long period of time. As an example, consider the following from the airmiles dataset which charts the number of passenger miles on US commercial airlines from 1937 to 1960. The following figure shows the number of accidental deaths in the United States from 1973 until 1979 by month taken from the USAccDeaths data frame. This line graph clearly shows a seasonal difference where there are more accidental deaths in the summer months than winter and detecting this type of seasonal variation is one of the strengths of a line graph. As one final example, the following figure shows the approval rating for US Presidents from 1945 until 1975 taken from the presidents data frame. This line graph shows a very high approval rating in 1945 (Roosevelt at the end of WWII) with dips in the early 1950’s (Truman and the Korean Conflict) and about 1974 (Watergate and Nixon’s resignation). Notice that there are two gaps in the line (late 1940’s and 1973) caused by missing data in the data frame. 8.4.1 Demonstration: Line Graph Line graphs like those shown above are very useful for detecting a change in some variable, especially over time. The following script creates a line graph of the monthly number of lung disease deaths in the United Kingdom between 1974 and 1979 as found in the ldeaths data frame. It shows a very interesting cycle where there are consistently more deaths in the winter months than the summer months. Line 2: The plot function is called for the ldeaths data frame. By itself, plot will create a scatter plot but Line 6 in this script specifies a line graph. Lines 3-5: This creates the main title of the line graph along with the labels for the x-axis and y-axis. Line 6: This specifies the type of line graph wanted. The possible values are: p for points l for lines (this is a lower-case “L”) b for both c for the lines part alone of “b” o for both ’overplotted’ (that is a lower-case “O”, not zero) h for ‘histogram-like’ (or ‘high-density’) vertical lines s for stair steps (that is a lower-case “S”) S for other steps (that is a capital “S”) n for no plotting Researchers could quickly try several different settings to determine the best way to present the data and students working through this tutorial can change the value on Line 6 to see the different types of plots. Line 7: The lwd parameter sets the width of the line. The default value is 1 so this line specifies a double-width line in order to make it easier to see.

Scatter plots are often used in connection with correlation where they visually indicate the correlation between two variables. For example, The following figure is the plot of stopping distance vs. speed from the cars data frame. The previous figure shows that as a car’s speed increases the stopping distance also increases, which is exactly what would be expected. (Note: this data were gathered on cars in the 1920s.) Often, a line of best fit is included with a plot to better visualize the relationship between the two variables, as illustrated in the following figure. As a second example, The following figure is a plot of the eruption time for Old Faithful geyser, taken from the faithful data frame, as a function of the waiting time between eruptions. The previous figure shows that as the time between eruptions increases the time that the eruption lasts also increases. Notice that this scatter plot also suggests that the data are bi-modal since there are two clusters of points and a researcher would want to explore that matter before doing much else with the data. 8.5.1 Plot Point Types R has 25 different types of symbols that could be used for the points on a plot as shown on the following chart. Symbols numbered 1-20 are a single color but symbols 21-25 have two colors and both the background and line color can be specified. Using black for the line color (the default) and a background color that has high contrast with the plot area makes the points easier to see on a graph. The point symbol used is specified in the pch= attribute as demonstrated in the following plots. 8.5.2 Demonstration: Plot The following script creates a simple plot using the swiss data frame. Line 2: This starts the plot function. Like many R functions, plot requires a formula input in the form of y ~ x where the dependent variable (the y-axis) is first in the formula and the independent variable (the x-axis) is second. For this plot, Education is the independent variable and will be on the x-axis while Fertility is the dependent variable on the y-axis. The researcher was answering the question “Does education level affect the number of children people have?” Lines 3-5: This creates the main title and the labels for the x-axis and y-axis. Line 6: The pch attribute is the type of point used on the graph. R has a number of pre-defined types of points, as illustrated above, and for this graph type number 21 is selected. Line 7: The background color of the points is specified using the bg attribute. This this case it is a shade of chartreuse, a yellow-green hue. Line 8: The line color of the circle is specified using the col attribute. eyJsYW5ndWFnZSI6InIiLCJzYW1wbGUiOiIjIFNpbXBsZSBQbG90XG5wbG90KHN3aXNzJEZlcnRpbGl0eSB+IHN3aXNzJEVkdWNhdGlvbixcbiAgbWFpbiA9IFwiU3dpc3MgSW5kaWNhdG9yc1wiLFxuICB4bGFiID0gXCJFZHVjYXRpb25cIixcbiAgeWxhYiA9IFwiRmVydGlsaXR5XCIsXG4gIHBjaCA9IDIxLFxuICBiZyA9IFwiY2hhcnRyZXVzZTNcIixcbiAgY29sID0gXCJibGFja1wiXG4pXG4ifQ== The following script creates a plot with a line of best fit. Lines 2-9: This demonstration plots two vectors from the attitude data frame, rating is the independent variable on the x-axis while complaints is the dependent variable on the y-axis. The researcher was answering the question “Do employees with higher overall ratings handle complaints better?” The other parameters of this plot function are defined for the previous plot and are not further discussed here. Line 10: This starts the abline function that ends on line 13. Abline draws a line “from point A to point B” (which is why the function is named “abline”) on an existing plot. In this case, the line to be drawn is calculated with the lm function, which calculates the slope and y-intercept of the line of best fit for the two specified vectors. The lm function was introduced in the tutorial about Correlation and Regression. Lines 11-12: These are the parameters for the line of best fit as drawn on the plot. eyJsYW5ndWFnZSI6InIiLCJzYW1wbGUiOiJcbiMgTGluZSBvZiBCZXN0IEZpdFxucGxvdChhdHRpdHVkZSRjb21wbGFpbnRzIH4gYXR0aXR1ZGUkcmF0aW5nLFxuICBtYWluID0gXCJBdHRpdHVkZSBEYXRhXCIsXG4gIHhsYWIgPSBcIk92ZXJhbGwgUmF0aW5nXCIsXG4gIHlsYWIgPSBcIkNvbXBsYWludHNcIixcbiAgcGNoID0gMjEsXG4gIGJnID0gXCJraGFraTJcIixcbiAgY29sID0gXCJibGFja1wiXG4pXG5hYmxpbmUobG0oYXR0aXR1ZGUkY29tcGxhaW50cyB+IGF0dGl0dWRlJHJhdGluZyksXG4gIGx3ZCA9IDIsXG4gIGNvbCA9IFwiZGFya3NlYWdyZWVuNFwiXG4pXG4ifQ== 8.5.3 Guided Practice: Plot Using the rock data frame, create a plot of area (y-axis) as a function of peri (x-axis).

Creating a histogram or density plot is very helpful in that regard, but a Q-Q (“Quantile-Quantile”) Plot is a typical method used to determine if a data frame is normally distributed. The following figure is a Q-Q plot of the New York City temperatures in the airquality data frame. An absolutely perfect normal distribution would generate a straight line Q-Q plot and the blue line in the previous figure is ideal. Interpreting a Q-Q plot is more art than science but as long as most values are near the ideal line then the data are considered normally distributed. The following figure is a Q-Q plot for the Old Faithful eruption, as plotted earlier in this tutorial. The above plot shows a typical bi-modal pattern. On the left side of the plot is a reasonably flat area from -3 to -0.5 on the x-axis and then the plot skips upward and creates a second reasonably flat area between 0.5 and 3. Imagine two parallel lines running through the lower and upper parts of the plot and then notice that the green “ideal” line does not get very close to the slope of either of those two lines. This Q-Q plot shows that the data are not normally distributed. The following figure shows a curved Q-Q plot that is typical for a data frame that is skewed. In this case, the plotted sunspot data have a heavy positive skew which is indicated by the long “tail” on the left side of the plot. That skew should be verified with a histogram or density plot. 8.6.1 Demonstration: Q-Q Plot The following script creates a Q-Q plot for a normally-distributed data frame. Lines 2-4: This executes the qqnorm function and passes that function the weight variable from the chickwts data frame. This function draws the Q-Q Plot. The only parameter needed is main, which adds the title to the plot. Lines 6-9: This executes the qqline function and passes that function the weight variable from the chickwts data frame. This function draws the straight line that indicates a perfect Q-Q plot. The only parameters passed to the function in this script is to set the size to 2 and the color to blue, in the same way for the scatterplots above. eyJsYW5ndWFnZSI6InIiLCJzYW1wbGUiOiIjIFEtUSBQbG90XG5xcW5vcm0oY2hpY2t3dHMkd2VpZ2h0LFxuICBtYWluID0gXCJRUSBQbG90OiBDaGljayBXZWlnaHRzXCJcbilcbiMgUT1RIExpbmVcbnFxbGluZShjaGlja3d0cyR3ZWlnaHQsXG4gIGx3ZCA9IDIsXG4gIGNvbCA9IFwiYmx1ZVwiXG4pXG4ifQ== 8.6.2 Guided Practice: Q-Q Plot Using the swiss data frame, create a Q-Q plot of the Fertility vector.

["parametric-hypothesis-testing.html", "Lab 9 Parametric Hypothesis Testing 9.1 Introduction 9.2 Hypothesis 9.3 ANOVA 9.4 T-test 9.5 Deliverable", " Lab 9 Parametric Hypothesis Testing 9.1 Introduction Researchers should always begin a project with a hypothesis and then gather data to see if the hypothesis supports an underlying theory in a process commonly called the scientific method. Continuous data gathered as part of the research project are analyzed using parametric techniques and two of the most commonly-used tests are described in this lab. This lab starts with a discussion of “hypothesis” since that is key to both parametric and nonparametric testing. 9.2 Hypothesis A hypothesis is an attempted explanation for some observation and is often used as a starting point for further investigation. For example, imagine that a physician notices that babies born of women who smoke seem to weigh less than for women who do not smoke. That could lead to a hypothesis like “smoking during pregnancy is linked to lighter birth-weights.” As another example, imagine that a restaurant owner notices that tipping seems to be higher on weekends than through the week. That might lead to a hypothesis that “the size of tips is higher on weekends than weekdays.” After creating a hypothesis, a researcher would gather data and then statistically analyze those data to determine if the hypothesis is valid. Additional investigation may be needed to explain why that observation is true. In a research project, there are usually two related competing hypotheses: the Null Hypothesis and the Alternate Hypothesis. Null Hypothesis (abbreviated H0). This is sometimes described as the “skeptical” view; that is, the explanation for some observed phenomena was mistaken. For example, the null hypothesis for the smoking mother observation mentioned above would be “smoking has no effect on a baby’s weight” and for the tipping observation would be “there is no difference in tipping on the weekend.” Alternate Hypothesis (abbreviated Ha). This is the hypothesis that is being suggested as an explanation for the observed phenomenon. In the case of the smoking mothers mentioned, above the alternative hypothesis would be that smoking causes a decrease in birth weight. This is called the “alternate” because it is different from the status quo which is encapsulated in the null hypothesis. One commonly-used example of the difference between the null and alternate hypothesis comes from the trial court system. When a jury deliberates about the guilt of a defendant they start from a position of “innocent until proven guilty,” which would be the null hypothesis. The prosecutor is asking the jury to accept the alternate hypothesis, or “the defendant committed the crime.” For the most part, researchers will never conclude that the alternate hypothesis is true. There are always confounding variables that are not considered but could be the cause of some observation. For example, in the smoking mothers example mentioned above, even if the evidence indicates that babies born to smokers weigh less the researcher could not state conclusively that smoking caused that observation. Perhaps non-smoking mothers had better health care, perhaps they had better diets, perhaps they exercised more, or any of a number of other reasonable explanations not related to smoking. For that reason, the result of a research project is normally reported with one of two phrases: The null hypothesis is rejected. If the evidence indicates that there is a significant difference between the status quo and whatever was observed then the null hypothesis would be rejected. For the “tipping” example above, if the researcher found a significant difference in the amount of money tipped on weekends compared to weekdays then the null hypothesis (that is, tipping is the same on weekdays and weekends) would be rejected. The null hypothesis cannot be rejected. If the evidence indicates that there is no significant difference between the status quo and whatever was observed then the researcher would report that the null hypothesis could not be rejected. For example, if there was no significant difference in the birth weights of babies born to smokers and non-smokers then the researcher failed to reject the null hypothesis. Often, a research hypothesis is based on a prediction rather than an observation and that hypothesis can be tested. Imagine a hypothesis like “walking one mile a day for one month decreases blood pressure.” A researcher could test this by measuring the blood pressure of a group of volunteers, have them walk a mile every day for a month, and then measure their blood pressure at the end of the experiment to see if there was any significant difference. 9.3 ANOVA An Analysis of Variance (ANOVA) is used to analyze the difference in more than two groups of samples that are normally distributed. Notice that an ANOVA is used when there are more than two groups being analyzed, which will distinguish between an ANOVA and a t-test (which is covered in the next section). For example, imagine that a professor was testing a hypothesis that tutoring improves students’ grades. A class is split into three groups such that one group was not required to attend tutoring, a second group was required to attending tutoring once a week, and a third group was required to attend tutoring two or more times a week. The null hypothesis (H0) is “The amount of tutoring does not significantly change students’ scores on the final exam.” The alternate hypothesis (Ha) is “More frequent tutoring significantly changes students’ scores on the final test.” After the final exam was graded, an ANOVA could be administered and if that showed the test scores for those three groups of students had a significant difference then the null hypothesis would be rejected in favor of the alternate hypothesis. 9.3.1 Demonstration: ANOVA The R ANOVA function requires the two variables being compared to be input as a linear model (lm) formula in the form of y ~ x, where y is the dependent variable (measured outcomes) and x is the independent variable (the groups used to divide the measured outcomes). Also the data source is specified with a data = parameter. In the case of the professor’s Tutoring Efficacy hypothesis mentioned in the previous paragraph, the students’ final exam score would be the dependent variable, the measured outcome, while the amount of tutoring, the three tutoring groups, would be the independent variable. The following one-line script generates an ANOVA from the morley data frame. The speed of light was measured twenty times in each of five different experiments. To see if there is any significant difference in the groups of experiments an ANOVA would be calculated where the Speed is the measured outcome and the Expt are the experiment groups. eyJsYW5ndWFnZSI6InIiLCJzYW1wbGUiOiJcbiMgQU5PVkFcbmFub3ZhKGxtKFNwZWVkIH4gRXhwdCwgZGF0YSA9IG1vcmxleSkpXG4ifQ== The ANOVA function returns a lot of information, most of which is beyond the scope of this lab: &gt; # ANOVA &gt; anova(lm(Speed ~ Expt, data = morley)) Analysis of Variance Table Response: Speed Df Sum Sq Mean Sq F value Pr(&gt;F) Expt 1 72581 72581 13.041 0.0004827 *** Residuals 98 545444 5566 --- Signif. codes: 0 *** 0.001 ** 0.01 * 0.05 . 0.1 1 While an ANOVA function returns information that would be useful in a more thorough statistical analysis, this lab is only concerned with the p-value, 0.0004827, which is labeled Pr(&gt;F) and is found near the end of Line 6. Following that p-value, R helpfully prints a code to aid in determining the significance of the result, three asterisks in this case. The last line in the results then lists the meaning of the various codes used. P-values that fall between 0 and 0.001 are marked with three asterisks, as in this case, so it is significant at the 0.1% level (0.001), the greatest possible level.

Compare this with ANOVA (presented in the previous section) where more than two groups are compared. As an example, imagine that the spending habits of two similar groups of people are compared; do the residents of Tucson spend more on dining out than the residents of Phoenix? The null hypothesis (H0) is “People in Tucson and Phoenix spend the same amount of money when dining out.” The alternate hypothesis (Ha) is “People in Tucson and Phoenix spend different amounts of money when dining out.” Imagine that the dining bills of 100 people from both cities were recorded and it was discovered that the mean bill in Phoenix is $15.13 and in Tucson is $12.47. If a t-test determines that there was a significant difference in those two numbers the null hypothesis would be rejected. 9.4.1 Demonstration: T-test A t.test requires the two variables being compared to be input as a formula in the form of y ~ x, where y is the dependent variable (measured outcomes) and x is the independent variable (the groups used to divide the measured outcomes). Also the data source is specified with a data = parameter. In the case of the Dining Spending hypothesis mentioned in the previous paragraph, the size of the dining bills would be the dependent variable, the measured outcome, while the groups of diners, the two cities, would be the independent variable. The following one-line script generates a t-test from the sleep data frame. In this experiment, two soporific drugs (increases the hours of sleep) were given in two different strengths to twenty patients. To see if there is any significant difference in the two groups of patients a t-test would be calculated where the extra sleep is the measured outcome and the group is the strength of the drug given. eyJsYW5ndWFnZSI6InIiLCJzYW1wbGUiOiJcbiMgVC1UZXN0IChJbmRlcGVuZGVudClcbnQudGVzdChleHRyYSB+IGdyb3VwLCBkYXRhID0gc2xlZXApXG4ifQ== The t.test function returns a lot of information, most of which is beyond the scope of this lab: Welch Two Sample t-test data: extra by group t = -1.8608, df = 17.776, p-value = 0.07939 alternative hypothesis: true difference in means is not equal to 0 95 percent confidence interval: -3.3654832 0.2054832 sample estimates: mean in group 1 mean in group 2 0.75 2.33 While a t.test function returns information that would be useful in a more thorough statistical analysis, this lab is only concerned with the p-value, 0.07939, which is found at the end of Line 3. 9.4.2 Guided Practice: T-test Using the npk data frame, calculate a t-test for the yield output for when grouped by N. 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 9.4.3 Activity: T-test Using the cafe data, conduct a t.test and report the p-value for the following variables.

Categorical data gathered as part of the research project are analyzed using nonparametric techniques and two of the most commonly-used tests are described in this lab. (Note: the concept of “hypothesis” is discussed in Parametric Hypothesis Testing.) 10.2 Kruskal-Wallis H This test is used to determine if there are any significant differences in three or more groups of data that are not normally-distributed, often categorical. Imagine that a researcher wanted to determine if there was a difference in smoking habit by age group. The subjects were interviewed and asked about how many packs they smoked per week. This data were skewed to the right since a few subjects smoked heavily but most were non-smokers or only smoked a few packs per week. The subjects were also divided into age groups: &lt;20, 20-29, 30-39, 40-49, &gt;49. The researcher would then use a Kruskal-Wallis H test to see if there was a significant difference in smoking habit by age group since the dependent variable (packs smoked) was not normally distributed. 10.2.1 Demonstration: Kruskal-Wallis H The R kruskal.test function requires the two variables being compared to be input in the form of y ~ x, where y is the dependent variable (measured outcomes) and x is the independent variable (the groups used to divide the measured outcomes). Also the data source is specified with a data = parameter. In the case of the smoking example mentioned in the previous paragraph, the number of packs smoked would be the dependent variable, the measured outcome, while the age group would be the independent variable. The following one-line script generates a kruskal.test from the airquality data frame. The amount of Ozone in the air was measured every day for several months. To see if there is any significant difference between the months a Kruskal-Wallis H would be calculated where the Ozone is the measured outcome and the Month is the grouping variable. eyJsYW5ndWFnZSI6InIiLCJzYW1wbGUiOiJcbiMgS3J1c2thbC1XYWxsaXMgSFxua3J1c2thbC50ZXN0KE96b25lIH4gTW9udGgsIGRhdGEgPSBhaXJxdWFsaXR5KVxuIn0= The kruskal.test function returns a lot of information, most of which is beyond the scope of this lab: Kruskal-Wallis rank sum test data: Ozone by Month Kruskal-Wallis chi-squared = 29.267, df = 4, p-value = 6.901e-06 While a kruskal.test function returns information that would be useful in a more thorough statistical analysis, this lab is only concerned with the p-value, 6.901e-06, which is found at the end of Line 3. Because this is less than 0.05 (5%) it would be considered a significant result. Thus, the null hypothesis would be rejected (that there was no difference in Ozone by Month). Notice that this test does not indicate which month had the greatest ozone reading or if all months had some sort of significant variance from the mean, just that there is a significant difference between the months. 10.2.2 Guided Practice: Kruskal-Wallis H Using the ChickWeight data frame, calculate a Kruskal-Wallis H for the weight output when grouped by Diet. 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 10.2.3 Activity: Kruskal-Wallis H Using the cafe data, conduct a Kruskal-Wallis H and report the p-value for the following variables.

Imagine that a movie producer wanted to know if there was a difference in the way the audience in two different cities responded to a movie. The null hypothesis (H0) is “There is no difference in movie-goers’ opinions between these two cities.” The alternate hypothesis (Ha) is “Movie-goers’ opinions are significantly different by city.” As the audience members left the theater they would be asked to rate the movie on a scale of one to five stars. The ratings for the two cities would be collected and then a Mann-Whitney test would be used to determine if the difference in ratings between the cities was significant. 10.3.1 Demonstration: Mann-Whitney U R uses the wilcox.test function for several different types of nonparametric tests. It will automatically compute a Mann-Whitney U test when the dependent variable is numeric and the independent variable is binary (that is, only two levels). The wilcox.test function requires the two variables being compared to be input in the form of y ~ x, where y is the dependent variable (measured outcomes) and x is the independent variable (the two groups used to divide the measured outcomes). Also the data source is specified with a data = parameter. In the case of the movie analysis example mentioned in the previous paragraph, the number of movie rating would be the dependent variable, the measured outcome, while the city would be the independent, or grouping, variable. The following one-line script generates a Mann-Whitney U from the CO2 data frame. The amount of CO2 uptake of a group of plants was measured while chilled or not chilled. To see if there is any significant difference between the cold tolerance of those plants, a Mann-Whitney U test would be calculated where the uptake is the measured outcome and the Treatment is the grouping variable. eyJsYW5ndWFnZSI6InIiLCJzYW1wbGUiOiJcbiMgTWFubi1XaGl0bmV5IFVcbndpbGNveC50ZXN0KHVwdGFrZSB+IFRyZWF0bWVudCwgZGF0YSA9IENPMilcbiJ9 The wilcox.test function returns a lot of information, most of which is beyond the scope of this lab: Warning message: cannot compute exact p-value with ties Wilcoxon rank sum test with continuity correction data: uptake by Treatment W = 1187.5, p-value = 0.006358 alternative hypothesis: true location shift is not equal to 0 The warning message can be ignored. It is indicating that some of the values in the Treatment vector are repeated (“tied”), but that is expected since more than one plant in this study got the same treatment. The estimated p-value is adequate for most research projects. While a wilcox.test function returns information that would be useful in a more thorough statistical analysis, this lab is only concerned with the p-value, 0.006358, which is found at the end of Line 4. Because this is less than 0.05 (5%) it would be considered a significant result. 10.3.2 Guided Practice: Mann-Whitney U Using the mtcars data frame, calculate a Mann-Whitney U for the disp output when grouped by am. 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 10.3.3 Activity: Mann-Whitney U Using the cafe data, conduct a Mann-Whitney U and report the p-value for the following variables.

["about-colors.html", "A About Colors A.1 Basic Colors A.2 Color Palette A.3 Custom Palette", " A About Colors Most visualization tasks in R are enhanced by the use of color. Color can make groups stand out or make it easy to quickly determine what a graph is saying. A.1 Basic Colors Consider the following plot of the faithful data frame. plot(faithful, main = &quot;Old Faithful Information&quot;, xlab = &quot;Eruption Time&quot;, ylab = &quot;Waiting Time&quot;, pch = 19 ) The dots in the above scatter plot are black and easy enough to see, but R can color the dots in order to make the visualization more appealing and, perhaps, enhance the readability of the report. R has a vocabulary of 657 basic colors (including 99 levels of grey), and those color names can be spcified with any plot. A PDF file, Rcolor.pdf, is available that lists all of the colors along with a small sample of each. As an example, the following code chunk draws the same faithful plot displayed above, but the color firebrick3 is named on line 6 so the dots are a red color. That color can be changed to any of the 657 colors available so the plot meets the researcher’s needs. The color specification in the following script can be changed and the script re-run to explore the available R colors. eyJsYW5ndWFnZSI6InIiLCJzYW1wbGUiOiJwbG90KGZhaXRoZnVsLFxuICAgICBtYWluID0gXCJPbGQgRmFpdGhmdWwgSW5mb3JtYXRpb25cIixcbiAgICAgeGxhYiA9IFwiRXJ1cHRpb24gVGltZVwiLFxuICAgICB5bGFiID0gXCJXYWl0aW5nIFRpbWVcIixcbiAgICAgcGNoID0gMTksXG4gICAgIGNvbCA9IFwiZmlyZWJyaWNrM1wiXG4gICAgIClcbiJ9 When using color with graphics it is important for the researcher to keep two points in mind. First, it is estimated that about 8% of males and 0.5% of females are unable to distinguish between two or more colors, a condition that is often called “color blindness.” Second, if the research is ever printed in a black-and-white form then all color information is lost. For these two reasons, it is probably best to not rely on color alone to provide information to the reader; rather, color should be used to enhance the understanding of a chart without being a sole source of information for that chart. A.2 Color Palette Often, a visualization will require more than one color to properly display the data. Consider, for example, this bar plot from the mtcars data frame. barplot(height = table(mtcars$cyl, mtcars$gear), main = &quot;Cars by Gears and Cylinders&quot;, xlab = &quot;Gears&quot;, ylab = &quot;Count&quot;, legend = TRUE, beside = TRUE, args.legend = list(title = &quot;Cylinders&quot;) ) Since no color is specified, the default colors are applied. The shades of grey are useable but there are easy ways to make the plot more pleasing and useful. R includes five color palettes that contain multiple color combinations and those can be used with visualizations that require more than one color. Here are samples from the five primary color palettes. The palettes are applied to a visual with the col= command. The number of colors to use from the given palette is specified in the parenthesis following the palette name. Here is how each of the palettes are specified in a visualization. col = cm.colors(5) col = heat.colors(3) col = rainbow(7) col = terrain.colors(8) col = topo.colors(4) Adding the heat color palette on the last line of the script for the barplot makes it easier to read. This is an interactive block of code and the palette can be changed to explore these five palettes. It may also be interesting to change the number of colors to see how that changes the actual colors selected. eyJsYW5ndWFnZSI6InIiLCJzYW1wbGUiOiJiYXJwbG90KGhlaWdodCA9IHRhYmxlKG10Y2FycyRjeWwsIG10Y2FycyRnZWFyKSxcbiAgbWFpbiA9IFwiQ2FycyBieSBHZWFycyBhbmQgQ3lsaW5kZXJzXCIsXG4gIHhsYWIgPSBcIkdlYXJzXCIsXG4gIHlsYWIgPSBcIkNvdW50XCIsXG4gIGxlZ2VuZCA9IFRSVUUsXG4gIGJlc2lkZSA9IFRSVUUsXG4gIGFyZ3MubGVnZW5kID0gbGlzdCh0aXRsZSA9IFwiQ3lsaW5kZXJzXCIpLFxuICBjb2wgPSBoZWF0LmNvbG9ycygzKVxuKVxuIn0= A.3 Custom Palette Designers must be careful about using multiple hues on a single visual display since that creates what is sometimes called “clown’s pants” due to the extreme patchy color scheme. The goal of using color is to make visualizations easier to understand, but plots with too many colors can be distracting and render the data confusing. Instead, it is generally a best practice to use only shades of the same color or gentle gradients from one color to another. For example, the following script produces the bar plot seen in the previous figure but using only shades of blue. The first line of the script creates a custom palette named colpal (for “color palette”), which, essentially, creates color codes for plots. In this case, the function will create the codes for color gradients between blue and white. Note: While any two colors can be specified for colorRampPalette, only one hue should be selected along with either white or black in order to make plots more usable for readers who are color blind. The col= line sets the color for this plot by using colpal and specifying three colors. To explore this capability, change the colors in the colorRampPalette() command and the number of colors to select and run the script. eyJsYW5ndWFnZSI6InIiLCJzYW1wbGUiOiJcbiMgQ2x1c3RlcmVkIEJhciBQbG90IFdpdGggR3JhZGllbnQgQ29sb3JzXG5jb2xwYWwgPC0gY29sb3JSYW1wUGFsZXR0ZShjKFwiYmx1ZVwiLCBcIndoaXRlXCIpKVxuXG5iYXJwbG90KGhlaWdodCA9IHRhYmxlKG10Y2FycyRjeWwsIG10Y2FycyRnZWFyKSxcbiAgbWFpbiA9IFwiQ2FycyBieSBHZWFycyBhbmQgQ3lsaW5kZXJzXCIsXG4gIHhsYWIgPSBcIkdlYXJzXCIsXG4gIHlsYWIgPSBcIkNvdW50XCIsXG4gIGxlZ2VuZCA9IFRSVUUsXG4gIGJlc2lkZSA9IFRSVUUsXG4gIGFyZ3MubGVnZW5kID0gbGlzdCh0aXRsZSA9IFwiQ3lsaW5kZXJzXCIpLFxuICBjb2wgPSBjb2xwYWwoMylcbilcbiJ9 "],
